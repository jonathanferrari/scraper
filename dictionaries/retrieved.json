After asking my parents if i could stay with a friend for the night, I started walking to his house, excited for what was ahead of me. After the Marijuana had been put into the baggie, we jumped in one of the guys' car, went to a dead end street not to far from our houses, and began to put the Marijuana in the pipe. I took my 5 moderate hits, and then we began to drive to Wal-Mart for munchies. In the car i didnt think i was high. but then someone asked me, are you feeling it? do you hear the music? I asked the driver of the car what kind of system he had, he said he didnt have one!!! At that point i realized i was high. \r\n\r\nAs we walked in i started thinking about it, and started laughing hysterically. I was laughing at everyone and everything, and when i was walking and doing things, it was like i didnt know what i was doing, but everything was being done automaticly. If you have seen the movie half-baked in the beginning when they are kids and walking into the store and everything is flashing, that is what it felt like. I kept getting very nervous, it felt like all the people were watching us, and i thought we were going to get in trouble. It was weird though, because i could concentrate to stop laughing, and i could do it. As we were leaving Wal-Mart i was trying to remember where the car was, and got lost for a couple of minutes, then remembered what it looked like. I got in the car and the 5 of us were cruising, when we saw two cops checking out a house, we all got so scared, we were like hurry the fuck up! They never even came out of the driveway. \r\n\r\nThe paranoid while high theory is true, everytime i saw a car on the road, i thought it was a cop and was ready to open the door and run, i was so damn scared. We were listening to the music, just sitting in the driveway, eating the chips we had bought. it sounded awesome. It sounded like they were playing in the car, we were listening to disturbed. After listening to the music, we wanted to get scared, so we walked in the woods, we got scared, i dont want to tell you what happened, but do it sometime, it is one hell of an experience. After that we went inside the house:\r\n\r\nALL MARIJUANA SMOKERS TRY THIS!!! TURN THE T.V. ON FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN TURN IT OFF, YOU CAN SEE THE ELECTRICITY STILL ON THE SCREEN, IT KICKS ASS. JUST CONCENTRATE, WE ALL SAW DIFFERENT THINGS. Then after that we tried to go to sleep, but i heard this really weird noise, it sounded like fish were jumping out of a lake and i could hear the water splashing, or another i described it was someone throwing stones into water. It was very neat, but it was kind of freaky. I asked anyone if they heard this, everyone said no except for one person, and he described it the exact same way,and was hearing it at the same time I was, that surprised me, and I wondered why we could hear it and no one else could.\r\nThat is about all I remember, Like i said, that was my first time getting high, and it was the best experience of my life so far, truly phenominal. It is a shame for this to be outlawed, if the politicians ever got high im sure they would want to legalize it. If we had one politician supporting it, all the MJ smokers would be backing them up. I am a good student, and no one would ever know what I did.\r\nI'm just the average teenager, you know.\r\n\r\n",

I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned, as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned in a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lungfull of mildly potent grass, spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).\r\n\r\nWe then proceeded to the yard where everyone was already lined up to go to sport.\r\n\r\nBy this time the effects were minimal, only a slight light-headed feeling, and that?s all that I was expecting, not in the slightest way able to foresee the incomprehensible psychological events which were about to take place.\r\n\r\nWaiting outside the bus I was completely capable of participating in a ?normal? conversation with a friend who was not on any drugs. I didn?t even have any fragmented thoughts; apart from the occasional illogical thought, I was totally straight. I was later told that if I had not told them that I just smoked some pot, they would not have known.\r\n          \r\n                 (now this is the good bit)\r\nI suddenly felt the urge to kneel down. It wasn?t an overpowering compulsion to get closer to the ground, rather a feeling of, ? i'll be a bit more comfortable if I kneel.?  So I did.\r\n\r\nThe way down seemed to be the turning point for the experience. The time dilation I experienced was incredible. What seemed to me an hour was only the time it took to get from a standing position to a kneel.\r\nI studied the warm sun?s rays, which splashed onto the semi-dried grass where I knelt. It seemed to remind me of a time in my childhood that I had long forgotten, when my parents would take me to the river where we used to live. And for an instant I was once again there, filled with the same uninhibited innocent bliss that only childhood (and apparently now drugs) could evoke.\r\n\r\nThis total bliss, although indescribably pleasant, came as a shock. I had experienced an emotion similar to this before, yet on a much higher dose. I stood up, and just as mysteriously and unexpectedly as the emotion came it dissipated, leaving me pondering what had just taken place.\r\n\r\nI made my way onto the bus and sat by the window.\r\n\r\nI was joined by a friend, who upon sitting down next to me sparked up a meaningless conversation, in which I involved myself for awhile. However, in my current state of mind I knew I would benefit more if I just turned and looked out the window, so I told him in a very polite way that I am incredibly sorry but I must turn and look out the window now. (He thought I was joking, but after seeing that I did not turn back to him he found another victim to bore with pointless chatter.)\r\n\r\nAs I was trying to figure out what had caused my bliss just a few minutes ago, I started to take greater notice of the lush green trees outside. Then just as suddenly a wondrous feeling came over me. This was many times more profound than before and it lasted for most of the 15-minute bus ride. During this time I lost my entire internal monologue, apart from the occasional ?wow? and ?what?s going on.? My mind was empty of verbal thought, instead filled with raw emotion, a type of bliss or ?nirvana,? if you will, so profusely mind-blowing that it brought tears to my eyes.\r\n\r\nAn endless psychological orgasm is perhaps the closest verbal description I can put to it.\r\n\r\nEvery stimulus from the outside world conveyed a type of wonder and pure undivided happiness that I have never seen the likes of before.\r\n\r\nThis utopia stopped when we reached the pools, but then an hour later on the bus home I experienced the same phenomenon as before, on the same amazingly vivid scale.\r\n\r\nAnd to this day I occasionally have a glimpse into this state without any drugs and find that the world seems to have much more wonder and beauty than it once had.",

I know it's a large price for such a small amount (4 oz is about $300 where I come from), but it was well worth it. It was my first hookup from this person (I will call him 'Steve'), and I had the usual hope/joy/fear feeling that comes from putting your trust in somebody you hardly know. Two days later, it happened, 'Steve' told me to meet him in class early; we would 'make the pass' there. A simple handshake and a smile was all it took. Now, normally, I don't like to do that stuff at school, because I believe that students that don't want to be exposed to 'drugs' at school have the right not to be (that and it's almost asking to get busted), but I made an exception that day. School flew by in a blur as I anticpated my enjoyment of the evening.\r\n\r\nI got home at 3:00 that afternoon, and made my preperations. A glass of lemonade to stave off cottonmouth, a carrot (a very effective way to eliminate ganja breath), and 'Are You Experienced?' by Jimmy Hendrix was all I needed.\r\n\r\nAt exactly 4:20 I packed my bowl and sparked up. I took a few 'warm-up hits' (I hadn't toked up in a while) and took a few more regular hits. I then repacked and relit. \r\n\r\nNow, I don't know if it was something in the ganja, or if my lungs just reacted strangely, but when I was about ready to take another hit, I involuntarily inhaled VERY deeply. I was overcome instantly with a feeling of extreme disorientation and confusion. I put my bowl away and just sat there for a while. I ate my carrot and sipped the lemonade as I felt the first effects of cottonmouth coming on. I put Jimmy on and listened for a while. \r\n\r\nWhen 'The Wind Cries Mary' came on, I felt a funny feeling in my ears. You know when you have the munchies and eat something crunchy and get that really good feeling in your jaws? Well, I had that, only in my ears! It was the most amazing feeling I have had in my life so far (I'm only 16). I sat there for what seemed like hours, listening to 'The Wind Cries Mary'. I downed the last of my lemonade and grabbed a pack of gum on my way outside to see what I could see.\r\n\r\nI sat in my back yard, chewing gum and watching the sun set. It was incredably beautiful. All the colors and shapes seemed to dance in the sky, just for me. I felt deeply awed and honored to be able to see this sunset. I sat and thought about myself and my life, and their directions. I learned some pretty deep stuff about myself that evening. For example, I found that by unintentionally acting like an asshole for most of my youth, I had hurt some people pretty badly, and had really been a major source of bad vibes. Others did not hurt me, I only hurt myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down, I felt reborn. I wanted to put my lessons learned into use. My life was going to be better from now on, I came back to school with a new mission. I made amends with all the people I had hurt. I got some wierd looks (apoligizing to somebody for something you had done 5 years ago will do that). And started to learn, not just be there. What were once D's and F's are now A's and B's. I have turned my life around, all because of a kind green bush that the U.S. government has decided must be outlawed because the think it is bad for people. It is because they do not listen to people like me. They refuse to hear the good, only the bad.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank Erowid for allowing me to voice my profound changes brought on by the kind bud. May we all learn greater lessons to come.",

                "text": "\nOk, i have determined to somehow get this off my chest, because everytime i try to verbally explain it, i feel as though i cannot relate how i feel in an effective way. This experience was, to me, so ground-shaking and awe inspiring that i am shaking even as i sit down to write about this.\r\n\r\nAnd i should say, that it is a very, very extended story, so feel free to get a drink, and get ready to burn up. I assure you, everything i say is as true, and accurate as i can recall, it is, i think, beneficial and therapuetic for me to put this down, to be able to let it go. So here goes...\r\n\r\nAlright, in the month of September of last year (1998), we had picked up this acid.  So we all dosed, (there were 5 of us)and continued our ritualistic 'get together-to-trip' biweekly/triweekly thing.  But what we did not know, is that this acid was very, very different from what we have ever dosed before.\r\n\r\nEveryone all agreed the day after, (under which, the effects STILL lingered) that this acid was definately different from what we have ever tried before. I remember sitting in my livingroom with my buddies, looking over to two of my friends sitting on another couch, and they slowly turned into a one-point perspective black-and-white pencil drawing. I also remember walking into my kitchen and seeing my cat lie on the table facing away from me, he turned his head around (like an owl does) and meowed at me, i remember standing there for at least 20 to 25 minutes just thinking about things like; 'what happened to him as a kitten that would make him meow at me that exact way at that exact time' you know, just over-analyzing the entire microcosmic situation. But the thing that really got me, was that i was sitting in an upright position on my couch, just listening to the entire conversation, and not speaking, and all of the sudden, the entire range of my vision started to receed, to the point where it looked as though i was looking at the world through two holes that seemed to get smaller the farther i got got away from them, and bef!\r\nore i knew it, those to holes became attached to two tunnels, which dropped down, like a submarine telescope.\r\n\r\nIt then went black, and i was sitting in a metal chair in a vast, black and empty room, for some odd reason, i knew it was round, and somehow i also knew it was big. i was siiting in this chair with armrests on it, and at the bottom of the chair, there was a poll attached to it, this thin pole extended farther and farther down until it dissapeared in the dark of this room, so it felt as though i was sitting in this suspended chair directly in the middle of this vast, empty room.\r\n\r\nI remember trying to figure out what exactly was going on here when something totally weird and unexpected happened. I started to become aware, with all 5 senses, of the entire environment that my body was in, simultaneously with the 5 senses i was experiencing within this room on this chair.\r\n\r\nI remember that after the trip, i asked my friends if i had blacked out at all throughout the entire trip, and they said no, that i was 'just sitting there, staring at them'.  Needless to say, i tried desperately to crawl back to my 'normal' state of mind, and grasp for some sort of security to ground myself, i was unsuccessful in doing this, so i just toughed it out, although suicide was a common thought that night, for i feared that i would remain in this state forever.\r\n\r\n*End of Introduction*\r\n\r\nSo, since then, i have felt as though there are two 'parts' to me, constantly at war. Of the 5 friends i have been with, only one is still around, whom i had known the longest, and is a true brother of mine (i should also include that that night when we tripped, he told me that everything had a red tint to it, and at some point that night we visited a nearby lake, where he, at 5 in the morning, in September, stripped to his boxers and swam in the lake, for which i found out later was 'because the lake was the only thing that wasn't red, and i just had to be in it') He halfway understands what happened that night. But the ripples of the effects of the acid left me with so much confusion and awareness, that i began to change radically. \r\n\r\nSo the trip was over, and life goes on, with the complication of having a new awareness, i set out to continue my plans and goals for my future.\r\nUnfortunately, it was'nt that easy. Smoking weed was a very highly regarded pasttime for me, i loved the herb, and it loved me, but after that trip, every single time i got high, i felt half like i did on the acid, but halfway different. I would smoke exactly one hit from a pipe, and feel exactly how i would feel if i had smoked a nic with a bong, no shit! i would get extremely high, extremely easily, and i did'nt understand it. i would come close to having a fallout every single time i hit just one time.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know what i mean by fallout; i mean that i would experience the symptoms of an O.B.E.(out of body experience) My vision, better, my perception would shake left to right, with the speed increasing, as if the shaking were building enough momentum for a certain part of me to just take flight and exit.\r\n\r\nI would come to new and different realizations about everything and everyone around me, even the entire universe, the possibilities of my awareness seemed so unlimited, yet i was completely terrified of it. It was as though i had stripped down all the viels of my conditioning, and i was completely honest with myself about everything i percieved, so i recieved a whole and infinite understanding of everything. As if i was an infant, or prehistoric man. impulses to do things also became stronger, i became jumpy and unpredictable, even to myself.\r\n\r\nSo i quit smoking for SIX months! and i was completely sober, and all was well. But one night, as i was sitting on this very computer, the 'sickness' crept upon me, and my vision blurred whenever i turned my head or shifted my eyes, i started to get that feeling in my groin that you get when you trip, and my thoughts, along with my heart, were racing faster than i could keep up. \r\n\r\nI figured it would go away\r\n\r\nIt didn't.\r\n\r\nFor the next three days i experienced this, i could'nt drive, work, or do anything. I became increasingly afraid that something was seriously wrong with me i.e.: a tumor, etc.  So i made an appointment at the doctor's office. I went in, and i explained everything to him ( i might have left out the fact that when i had this 'sober-trip' that my left pupil was dialated, while the right was normal at all times)\r\n\r\nHe said that he was unsure about what was going on, we discussed the possibility of a flashback that turned into a permatrip(after the tumor was ruled out) and that it was possible with some people to experience 'hypersensitivity' whenever something s that causes shock occurs. Hypersensitivity meaning that all senses are improved.\r\nHe determined that that's what it was, and i just needed something to slow my mind down, and help with stress, i asked about the fact that marijuana usually does that for me, but he then told me that sometimes you build a tolerance to specific parts of the drug, and specific parts of the drug have their tolerences broken down. Kind of like cofee, or cigaretts.\r\nSo basically, what it came down to, and this is just my rendition of the phrase, but i sincerely feel that i have pried open my third eye, and i can never close it again.\r\n\r\nThe drug, that i took for 2 weeks, and then returned to normal, helped me to realize that i have two levels unto which i can percieve the world, one consists of the situation at hand, and the other pertains to the infinity that is always around us, and within us. I have been happy to stick with the first, because the latter is competely horrifying to me, but sometimes, that other side, which i have come to referr to as 'the sickness' creeps up and takes a hold of me, unto which i have designed many specific meditation techniques that have worked for me when i needed to get out of the hole my mind was digging.\r\n\r\nI am trying as hard as i can to decide if this is a gift or a curse. And i have also tried as hard as i could to try to diminish the fear, so one day, i can utilize this tool.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, i feel like this is a good ending, but i still feel as though i have'nt even scratched the surface of this, i'm sorry, but i am tired, and, ironically, i feel the 'sickness' creeping up on me again, i must sleep, thank you, and goodnight.",

            "text": "\nOk, i have determined to somehow get this off my chest, because everytime i try to verbally explain it, i feel as though i cannot relate how i feel in an effective way. This experience was, to me, so ground-shaking and awe inspiring that i am shaking even as i sit down to write about this.\r\n\r\nAnd i should say, that it is a very, very extended story, so feel free to get a drink, and get ready to burn up. I assure you, everything i say is as true, and accurate as i can recall, it is, i think, beneficial and therapuetic for me to put this down, to be able to let it go. So here goes...\r\n\r\nAlright, in the month of September of last year (1998), we had picked up this acid.  So we all dosed, (there were 5 of us)and continued our ritualistic 'get together-to-trip' biweekly/triweekly thing.  But what we did not know, is that this acid was very, very different from what we have ever dosed before.\r\n\r\nEveryone all agreed the day after, (under which, the effects STILL lingered) that this acid was definately different from what we have ever tried before. I remember sitting in my livingroom with my buddies, looking over to two of my friends sitting on another couch, and they slowly turned into a one-point perspective black-and-white pencil drawing. I also remember walking into my kitchen and seeing my cat lie on the table facing away from me, he turned his head around (like an owl does) and meowed at me, i remember standing there for at least 20 to 25 minutes just thinking about things like; 'what happened to him as a kitten that would make him meow at me that exact way at that exact time' you know, just over-analyzing the entire microcosmic situation. But the thing that really got me, was that i was sitting in an upright position on my couch, just listening to the entire conversation, and not speaking, and all of the sudden, the entire range of my vision started to receed, to the point where it looked as though i was looking at the world through two holes that seemed to get smaller the farther i got got away from them, and bef!\r\nore i knew it, those to holes became attached to two tunnels, which dropped down, like a submarine telescope.\r\n\r\nIt then went black, and i was sitting in a metal chair in a vast, black and empty room, for some odd reason, i knew it was round, and somehow i also knew it was big. i was siiting in this chair with armrests on it, and at the bottom of the chair, there was a poll attached to it, this thin pole extended farther and farther down until it dissapeared in the dark of this room, so it felt as though i was sitting in this suspended chair directly in the middle of this vast, empty room.\r\n\r\nI remember trying to figure out what exactly was going on here when something totally weird and unexpected happened. I started to become aware, with all 5 senses, of the entire environment that my body was in, simultaneously with the 5 senses i was experiencing within this room on this chair.\r\n\r\nI remember that after the trip, i asked my friends if i had blacked out at all throughout the entire trip, and they said no, that i was 'just sitting there, staring at them'.  Needless to say, i tried desperately to crawl back to my 'normal' state of mind, and grasp for some sort of security to ground myself, i was unsuccessful in doing this, so i just toughed it out, although suicide was a common thought that night, for i feared that i would remain in this state forever.\r\n\r\n*End of Introduction*\r\n\r\nSo, since then, i have felt as though there are two 'parts' to me, constantly at war. Of the 5 friends i have been with, only one is still around, whom i had known the longest, and is a true brother of mine (i should also include that that night when we tripped, he told me that everything had a red tint to it, and at some point that night we visited a nearby lake, where he, at 5 in the morning, in September, stripped to his boxers and swam in the lake, for which i found out later was 'because the lake was the only thing that wasn't red, and i just had to be in it') He halfway understands what happened that night. But the ripples of the effects of the acid left me with so much confusion and awareness, that i began to change radically. \r\n\r\nSo the trip was over, and life goes on, with the complication of having a new awareness, i set out to continue my plans and goals for my future.\r\nUnfortunately, it was'nt that easy. Smoking weed was a very highly regarded pasttime for me, i loved the herb, and it loved me, but after that trip, every single time i got high, i felt half like i did on the acid, but halfway different. I would smoke exactly one hit from a pipe, and feel exactly how i would feel if i had smoked a nic with a bong, no shit! i would get extremely high, extremely easily, and i did'nt understand it. i would come close to having a fallout every single time i hit just one time.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know what i mean by fallout; i mean that i would experience the symptoms of an O.B.E.(out of body experience) My vision, better, my perception would shake left to right, with the speed increasing, as if the shaking were building enough momentum for a certain part of me to just take flight and exit.\r\n\r\nI would come to new and different realizations about everything and everyone around me, even the entire universe, the possibilities of my awareness seemed so unlimited, yet i was completely terrified of it. It was as though i had stripped down all the viels of my conditioning, and i was completely honest with myself about everything i percieved, so i recieved a whole and infinite understanding of everything. As if i was an infant, or prehistoric man. impulses to do things also became stronger, i became jumpy and unpredictable, even to myself.\r\n\r\nSo i quit smoking for SIX months! and i was completely sober, and all was well. But one night, as i was sitting on this very computer, the 'sickness' crept upon me, and my vision blurred whenever i turned my head or shifted my eyes, i started to get that feeling in my groin that you get when you trip, and my thoughts, along with my heart, were racing faster than i could keep up. \r\n\r\nI figured it would go away\r\n\r\nIt didn't.\r\n\r\nFor the next three days i experienced this, i could'nt drive, work, or do anything. I became increasingly afraid that something was seriously wrong with me i.e.: a tumor, etc.  So i made an appointment at the doctor's office. I went in, and i explained everything to him ( i might have left out the fact that when i had this 'sober-trip' that my left pupil was dialated, while the right was normal at all times)\r\n\r\nHe said that he was unsure about what was going on, we discussed the possibility of a flashback that turned into a permatrip(after the tumor was ruled out) and that it was possible with some people to experience 'hypersensitivity' whenever something s that causes shock occurs. Hypersensitivity meaning that all senses are improved.\r\nHe determined that that's what it was, and i just needed something to slow my mind down, and help with stress, i asked about the fact that marijuana usually does that for me, but he then told me that sometimes you build a tolerance to specific parts of the drug, and specific parts of the drug have their tolerences broken down. Kind of like cofee, or cigaretts.\r\nSo basically, what it came down to, and this is just my rendition of the phrase, but i sincerely feel that i have pried open my third eye, and i can never close it again.\r\n\r\nThe drug, that i took for 2 weeks, and then returned to normal, helped me to realize that i have two levels unto which i can percieve the world, one consists of the situation at hand, and the other pertains to the infinity that is always around us, and within us. I have been happy to stick with the first, because the latter is competely horrifying to me, but sometimes, that other side, which i have come to referr to as 'the sickness' creeps up and takes a hold of me, unto which i have designed many specific meditation techniques that have worked for me when i needed to get out of the hole my mind was digging.\r\n\r\nI am trying as hard as i can to decide if this is a gift or a curse.

(I'm used to joints, sorry) After getting maybe 2 solid hits, and my friend getting maybe 4 or 5, we lay back and waited for the effects. All we felt was a mild pulsing at the top of the forehead, and for me, at the bottom of my chin, as well as a very warm feeling. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we decided we'd missed our window, so we decided to try again in a hour. We sipped some white wine, and smoked a tiny bowl of weed, perhaps about 3 hits a piece, then we tried the salvia again. \r\n\r\nThis time, the effects came and no mistake. I took about 6 hits, and then I lay back on the ground, I don't remember waiting for the effects to kick in. By the time I got the fourth one in, I was feeling it. It reminded me of the first part of an acid trip - millions of thoughts at once, they all tail off as if someone was holding them at one end, and burning them at the other. You have no sense of time, the sheer volume of thought, the recursiveness of the thoughts - by that I mean the repeating, connecting quality of them - totally shut you off from time. \r\n\r\nI tried to describe what I saw, but got nowhere. Then I couldn't remember if I had even tried to describe it to my friend, I sat up, or did I? I asked if I sat up, or did I? I had no idea then, or now, how many times, the next morning my friend said it was at least once.\r\n\r\nHe was not getting as high as I was, so he loaded the bong up again with salvia, and started taking hits, one so big it made him puke. While he cleaned that up, (and retched some more) I think I got a couple more hits out. So all in all, I think I had eight hits of salvia,  maybe 5 or 6 hits of pot, and about a glass and a half of white wine. \r\n\r\nAn hour seemed to take forever, and the effects only wear off very subtly and gradually. After another hour and the most intense effects had seemed to have subsided, we ate and talked for awhile, and conversation was not impossible, a bit difficult, but enjoyable. In the last two hours I was very into drawing and writing, free association is SUPER-easy on salvia. We went to sleep at about 1, and I was still feeling the halved-chopped memory effect. One crazy thing about this stuff is that it let me seek sleep much easier than acid. I think that has a lot to do with the hypnogogic quality of the closed-eye imagery. \r\n\r\nDue to the pure knock-out effects- by that I mean, time investment- weed or booze lets you drive quicker- I can't see doing this every day, and I think the deep qualities of salvia are probably something you get after more experience with it. This first time was just overwhelming and to be honest, I really wasn't looking for some huge metaphysical experience. I got pretty much what I wanted. Its different from acid (imo) in that its much milder as far as being in control. I wouldn't want to do acid more than a couple of times a month, maybe, but this, I could see maybe doing once a week. Acid seems to let you shove stuff to the left of your mind, to demand of your brain to stop thinking about something for a WHILE. It may pop up again tho?now, with salvia, you'll probably not remember too much about what you were thinking a minute ago, and if you think about anything too long, ie; 5 seconds, it'll just splinter and fracture into several other, related thoughts, which further fragment. \r\n\r\nWhat did I learn?

                "text": "\nThis account is the first of who-knows how many to come, a path that has led us to question much of what we thought reality to be.  It was an accident really, that propelled us into what has been a journey and a dream concerning our lives, and how they are connected.  \r\n\r\nWe took the long way to the farm on account of vague directions and even vaguer attention.  Farmer wanted us to camp with him, but we only planned to go out for the evening.  \r\n\r\nWe took a walk around the farm just after our arrival.  Farmer handed Jim and I what appeared to be an abused fig-newton.  It was his 'candy', he said.  It was figs and raisins and dates. and extracted THC, the psychoactive in Cannabis.  Farmer's candy is made with what is still a closely guarded recipe.  He told us we'd be staying the night and we nodded-  we planned on leaving late.  Little did we know that Farmer was right.  I had had some prior experience with smoking Cannabis, and the experimentation every high school student has with alcohol.  I didn't think Jim had experience with anything, but he took the candy without seeming hesitation.  They weren't horrible but they wouldn't sell on taste alone either.  \r\n\r\nAfter our walk I began to notice subtle shifts in attention span and depth of field.  I felt as though I was speaking from far away.  I remember asking Jim a question and then wondering if I had spoken at all.  He said he felt nothing.  My attention would drift without notice, and then when I became aware of it, I was unsure of how long I had been 'gone'.  My focus seemed to lock onto isolated quadrants, i.e. the plants directly around my feet as we walked, or a tree on the far bank, a spot on the water where the light flashed, etc.  Everything else was perfectly visible, but like a camera with a shallow field of focus, one area was observed with perfect clarity.  \r\n\r\nJim went off to do some thinking and meditate.  Farmer said Jim was high, although I couldn't tell.  Ten minutes ago I had been laughing in hysterics, and now I had become very foggy, worrying that I would lose track of the young dog I had brought along, despite how close she stayed all night.  \r\n\r\nFarmer alerted me to Jim, now sitting some distance off staring out over the fields.  I told Farmer that Jim was practicing a Zen meditation.  Farmer found this particularly amusing.  I was unsure.  I was beginning to feel the first wave of a paranoia that gripped both Jim and I that night.  If you like the candy, beware kids, whatever's inside.  is coming out!  I worked on it for a few moments and got it under control, riding the wave and paddling up to meet the next one.  We faced five or six of these 'waves' of paranoia over something or other.  Each one seemed weaker than the previous.  Farmer was there as the voice of experience, and experience has taught this psychonaut that it's always good to have a 'Tripmaster';  someone who has enough experience to go along with you for the journey, as well as cope with the 'real' world if necessary.  That voice of experience was needed when Jim came rushing back into camp.  \r\n\r\nI saw him running from a long way off and he seemed to take longer than I expected to arrive.  Not only depth perception was affected but perception of time as well.  What we thought to be an hour was fifteen minutes, six hours only two.  I was lying beside the camp-fire when Jim finally arrived.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first began to trip on the candy I took every opportunity to go pee and try and clear my head.  I kept wondering that if we had knowingly and willingly induced this state of mind that was euphoric and fearsome at the same time, then why did the mind seem to constantly try to reassert itself to it's standard frame of awareness?  I remember thinking at the time that these could not be higher states of consciousness then, but lower, more primal states.  After a good many other trips and 'conversations' with mushrooms later on, I changed my mind.  I think what we experienced that night on our initiation was resistance.  We go after an experience sometimes with a preconceived notion of what we will receive, when the truth is, we can only accept what we are given and transform it into what we needed all the long.  \r\n\r\nWhen Jim finally reached the camp he was frantic. He was dying, overdosing.  He was having an anxiety attack.  His heart was beating furiously and he couldn't breathe.  I wanted to tell him it was simply a rush, that my heart was pounding too, but my words seemed to come from a long way off and never made it past my lips.  Farmer tried to reassure Jim that everything was alright, but this was Jim's first experience with anything this strong, and he was not to be immediately calmed.  \r\n\r\nA lost tourist pulled up just then, and things got a little sticky.  Jim felt he was receiving no help from our group so he rushed up to the car window of the man and asked him to take him to the hospital.  Farmer, the Tripmaster, shooed Jim back toward the camp and got rid of the tourist, giving them directions and explaining that Jim was a newly diagnosed diabetic, and had forgotten his insulin.  We would have to ride into town to get some from a local pharmacy.  For one moment or two I thought we were going to spend the night or more in jail in Iowa!  \r\n\r\nFarmer talked Jim down and then took us for a walk.  Jim rode that first big wave of paranoia and then began to see a point of clarity that he could operate from, and we began to talk and sort out what we were feeling and thinking.  The waves seemed to stem from deep-seated fears or traumatizing events.  These were new stretches of the horizon for Jim, and to rush into it with little or no introduction, and to such depths I cannot imagine.  I tease him about it still, but never belittle.  \r\n\r\nI remember Jim handing me his soda bottle, asking me to hold it because he didn't trust himself with it.  I was barely able to hold onto my own, but took it out of reflex, painfully aware of the icy cold.  I didn't know Farmer very well at the time and at one time a distrust of him arose in me.  It stemmed from the vulnerability factor, and not trusting myself this time, I placed my pocket knife in the car, only to retrieve it moments later in case I needed it.  None of our fears were justified.  \r\n\r\nPeriodically riverboats passed lit for the night now, and Farmer seemed to lose his mind whenever one passed us.  He would leap out of his chair and run to the bank, once screaming at the Queen of Iowa.  Hey!  Can you hear me?!  He loved the moon, the riverboats, the sacred circle he believed we sat in, and the people who lived here before us.  Farmer would prove out to be a kind of mad mentor to us, a friend and gentle conspirator.  He was Wendell Berry's 'Mad Farmer'  with a shaman's rattle.  Thanks Farmer, for everything.  \r\n\r\nWe slept in the car toward the end of the evening.  Sleep was fitful, and when we did leave the next morning we were not entirely clear of the effects.  My attention drifted on the ride home.  Once, we came to wonder how we had arrived on the top of some grassy hill, and had to turn around and find our foggy way back.  Even after a nights sleep I was still foggy from the experience.  I worked at night and sometime around six in the morning I knew I was clear.  That would make the total run time about thirty-one hours of various states of altered consciousness, with the core intensity about six or seven hours.  \r\n\r\nI called Jim and we got together for a long walk and talk.  He decided never to place himself in these states again.  I felt somewhat the same on the tail end, but the more time that flowed between myself and the experience, I saw that I was more and more apt to experience and experiment again.  Did we gain anything from that experience?   I think so.  We faced our deepest fears, the ones we pack around with us on a daily basis, and we came through to the other side.  Like good travel, one always goes far from home, only to wish for our own bed again.  And once home we begin to think back and long for foreign dust on our shoes once more.  \r\n\r\nThis experience was had at a small, isolated farm just outside of a major city in Iowa.  Jim is still pursuing his spiritual and intellectual curiosities, as am I.  Farmer is still Farmer, and as far as I'm concerned that's a good thing.  I am planning to write more of these 'chapters', experimenting with LSA, Stropharia Cubenis, Mescaline, and Syrian Rue.

It was an accident really, that propelled us into what has been a journey and a dream concerning our lives, and how they are connected.  \r\n\r\nWe took the long way to the farm on account of vague directions and even vaguer attention.  Farmer wanted us to camp with him, but we only planned to go out for the evening.  \r\n\r\nWe took a walk around the farm just after our arrival.  Farmer handed Jim and I what appeared to be an abused fig-newton.  It was his 'candy', he said.  It was figs and raisins and dates. and extracted THC, the psychoactive in Cannabis.  Farmer's candy is made with what is still a closely guarded recipe.  He told us we'd be staying the night and we nodded-  we planned on leaving late.  Little did we know that Farmer was right.  I had had some prior experience with smoking Cannabis, and the experimentation every high school student has with alcohol.  I didn't think Jim had experience with anything, but he took the candy without seeming hesitation.  They weren't horrible but they wouldn't sell on taste alone either.  \r\n\r\nAfter our walk I began to notice subtle shifts in attention span and depth of field.  I felt as though I was speaking from far away.  I remember asking Jim a question and then wondering if I had spoken at all.  He said he felt nothing.  My attention would drift without notice, and then when I became aware of it, I was unsure of how long I had been 'gone'.  My focus seemed to lock onto isolated quadrants, i.e. the plants directly around my feet as we walked, or a tree on the far bank, a spot on the water where the light flashed, etc.  Everything else was perfectly visible, but like a camera with a shallow field of focus, one area was observed with perfect clarity.  \r\n\r\nJim went off to do some thinking and meditate.  Farmer said Jim was high, although I couldn't tell.  Ten minutes ago I had been laughing in hysterics, and now I had become very foggy, worrying that I would lose track of the young dog I had brought along, despite how close she stayed all night.  \r\n\r\nFarmer alerted me to Jim, now sitting some distance off staring out over the fields.  I told Farmer that Jim was practicing a Zen meditation.  Farmer found this particularly amusing.  I was unsure.  I was beginning to feel the first wave of a paranoia that gripped both Jim and I that night.  If you like the candy, beware kids, whatever's inside.  is coming out!  I worked on it for a few moments and got it under control, riding the wave and paddling up to meet the next one.  We faced five or six of these 'waves' of paranoia over something or other.  Each one seemed weaker than the previous.

                "text": "\nBefore I start, I realize that mixing substances like this can be dangerous, but I am a very frequent mind-flyer, and have done all the research possible for each of the substances BEFORE I tried them. Also, I realize slang changes over distance.  when I talk about cones, I'm talking about marijuana. \r\n\r\nIt was my best friend's birthday, and what better way to celebrate his 18th than by going to the casino?? There were 4 of us, me, R, B and W who were participating in the 'experiment' and a couple of others who were just along for the ride (and a bit of a smoke, too). Me and W had to go for a BIGTIME trek to go pickup the supplies for the night.  This included 1/4oz of pot, a bunch of pills and 1/2 g of crack cocaine.  This was the first time any of us had tried crack.  We had a little bit of pot to smoke on the way back to make the long return trip more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThen me and W met up with R and B and went to our local smoking-hangout, where we proceeded to have our pills and a smoke.  For the sake of caution, we all decided to only dump half a pill each (for now) and have a little smoke to pump ourselves up for the main event.  We got a bit stoned, and in my confusion, I dropped my remaining 2 pills on the ground somewhere!! Well that pissed me off no end, and I wasn't sure if I was gonna have any fun, but we trudged on anyway, not really noticing any effect from the pills.  \r\n\r\nWe found ourselves at this little kiddy park with a cool spinning thing right at the base of a very big, impressive.  W divided the crack up into equal portions for us all (it came as a very hard rock of white powder).  It crumbled up to a little bit each, and we proceeded to place it on top of ready-packed (with pot) cones and smoked ourselves stupid.\r\n\r\nW went first, and put a little bit of powder on top to try it.  After a little while he said it was 'unbelievable'  so I scooped up my entire portion for the night and smoked it in one go.  About 3 minutes later I scrabbled for my Walkman and put on my favorite track, which started to peak in its crescendo as I did.  I stood there for about 20mins with my eyes shut, swaying slightly, as I felt the music was a physical force, buffering me from side to side. Then my peak (which was by now as physical as the music was) flew up above my head and sat there for the tiniest fraction of a second, which then seemed to stretch out to eternity as I looked at my friends through the eyes of my peak.  My actual eyes were shut this whole time, but to this day I can still picture exactly what my friends looked like as I stood there, lost in a microsecond.\r\n\r\nThen, when I realized I was tensing up in preparation for something, I relaxed.\r\n\r\nBOOOOOM!!!!\r\nIt came flying down from above, and speared through my head, right to the tips of my toes.  PURE PLEASURE, MENTAL AND PHYSICAL.\r\nI almost fell over with the rush that followed, and my closed eyes were now witness to a roller coaster ride that no one else will ever know about simply because it took off right from the point where words lose their meaning.  I have had more intense experiences than this before, but none that took me so completely by surprise.  It was as if it was waiting for me to relax before it began its beautiful onslaught of giddy pleasure.\r\n\r\nAfter we had all had our experiences, we walked (a little unsteadily by now, since we were still smoking endless cones of pot) to the casino.  We thought it would be fun, but it sucked big time, coz we kept getting lost looking for each other, and a way out.  There were thousands and thousands of poker machines, and they just started driving everyone CrAZy with their DAMN ANNOYING NOISE!! We eventually found a way out, and met up with some more friends at the pub just up the main road from the casino. But everything seemed so insignificant after that beautiful, endless rush.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I will ever try crack again, but I'm very glad that I tried it for my best friend's 18th, and I definitely don't recommend that anyone take a substance as seriously dangerous as cocaine without taking every possible precaution. Myself and all my friends have cell phones, and at the slightest hint of trouble, were ready to call for help.\r\n\r\nRegarding comedowns:  We all smoked such a ridiculous amount of pot, that we were high for a coupla days, and probably came down in our sleep.",

There were 4 of us, me, R, B and W who were participating in the 'experiment' and a couple of others who were just along for the ride (and a bit of a smoke, too). Me and W had to go for a BIGTIME trek to go pickup the supplies for the night.  This included 1/4oz of pot, a bunch of pills and 1/2 g of crack cocaine.  This was the first time any of us had tried crack.  We had a little bit of pot to smoke on the way back to make the long return trip more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThen me and W met up with R and B and went to our local smoking-hangout, where we proceeded to have our pills and a smoke.  For the sake of caution, we all decided to only dump half a pill each (for now) and have a little smoke to pump ourselves up for the main event.  We got a bit stoned, and in my confusion, I dropped my remaining 2 pills on the ground somewhere!! Well that pissed me off no end, and I wasn't sure if I was gonna have any fun, but we trudged on anyway, not really noticing any effect from the pills.  \r\n\r\nWe found ourselves at this little kiddy park with a cool spinning thing right at the base of a very big, impressive.  W divided the crack up into equal portions for us all (it came as a very hard rock of white powder).  It crumbled up to a little bit each, and we proceeded to place it on top of ready-packed (with pot) cones and smoked ourselves stupid.\r\n\r\nW went first, and put a little bit of powder on top to try it.  After a little while he said it was 'unbelievable'  so I scooped up my entire portion for the night and smoked it in one go.  About 3 minutes later I scrabbled for my Walkman and put on my favorite track, which started to peak in its crescendo as I did.  I stood there for about 20mins with my eyes shut, swaying slightly, as I felt the music was a physical force, buffering me from side to side. Then my peak (which was by now as physical as the music was) flew up above my head and sat there for the tiniest fraction of a second, which then seemed to stretch out to eternity as I looked at my friends through the eyes of my peak.  My actual eyes were shut this whole time, but to this day I can still picture exactly what my friends looked like as I stood there, lost in a microsecond.\r\n\r\nThen, when I realized I was tensing up in preparation for something, I relaxed.\r\n\r\nBOOOOOM!!!!\r\nIt came flying down from above, and speared through my head, right to the tips of my toes.  PURE PLEASURE, MENTAL AND PHYSICAL.\r\nI almost fell over with the rush that followed, and my closed eyes were now witness to a roller coaster ride that no one else will ever know about simply because it took off right from the point where words lose their meaning.  I have had more intense experiences than this before, but none that took me so completely by surprise.  It was as if it was waiting for me to relax before it began its beautiful onslaught of giddy pleasure.\r\n\r\nAfter we had all had our experiences, we walked (a little unsteadily by now, since we were still smoking endless cones of pot) to the casino.  We thought it would be fun, but it sucked big time, coz we kept getting lost looking for each other, and a way out.  There were thousands and thousands of poker machines, and they just started driving everyone CrAZy with their DAMN ANNOYING NOISE!! We eventually found a way out, and met up with some more friends at the pub just up the main road from the casino. But everything seemed so insignificant after that beautiful, endless rush.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I will ever try crack again, but I'm very glad that I tried it for my best friend's 18th, and I definitely don't recommend that anyone take a substance as seriously dangerous as cocaine without taking every possible precaution. Myself and all my friends have cell phones, and at the slightest hint of trouble, were ready to call for help.\r\n\r\nRegarding comedowns:  We all smoked such a ridiculous amount of pot, that we were high for a coupla days, and probably came down in our sleep.</experience-text>\n",

                "text": "\nI recently tried smoking buddah.  What an experience it was.  The dosage was about 3 large bowls (by myself mind you).  I heard a lot about people smoking it and feeling great so I decided it was for me.  I lit up in the second floor of my garage where I have a small party room set up. I always heard that it worked fast, but for some reason I smoked all of it.  There was no reaction.  I was so disapointed because there was a school dance that night and I hoped to be stoned for it. So I thought what the hell I'll go have a couple of shots of vodka before I go that'll do the trick.  After about 30 minutes my mother called me in the house to eat.  I remember my mouth being extremely dry. While I was eating i went throught 5 glasses of soda.\r\n\r\nAbout 15 minutes into dinner I felt this huge sense of relaxation and calm. Then when I lifted my fork to put some steak in my mouth.... BAM! I whipped the fork across the room and couldn't explain why.  At this point I was way out of my mind so I went to my room and downed about 10 or 11 shots of vodka.  My friend came to pick me up and couldn't believe how messed up I was.  He kept laughing at me and asking if I was ok.  I was like yeah whatever.  After about 1 and 1/2 hours after smoking up I felt another wave of the tinglies come over me.  Then when we were pulling into the school parking lot I was the happiest I had ever been.  I remember feeling so at peace with myself and everyone else around me.\r\n\r\nI was looking at the street lights when all of a sudden the poles they were on began to bend over.  This seriously freaked me out as I had never heard of people hallucionating on weed before.  Then I looked to my friend to ask if he could see it and his face took on the form of a penguin.  I was seriously wacked out so i decided to make the best of it and just enjoy it. We were walking in when suddenly the school zoomed out away from us about 100 yards.  Then it zoomed in again about 2 minutes later.  So we went inside and it was about 2 hours from liftoff so I was definetely out there somewhere.  We got in on the dance floor and another peaceful wave hit me only this time it wouldn't recide.  It just got stronger, stronger, and stronger until it stayed there at the same level for about an hour or so.  All the while I saw patterns in things, not like out of nowhere like on acid or anything, but simply on tye-dye shirts or on the paint on the walls etc.  I would have spells where i would just stare at them and talk to them.  Then I got upset because a gnome I saw on a table wouldn't talk back to me (people must have been staring terribly).  So I decided to go outside for a minute and calm down.  Outside I discussed the dismemberment of the Grateful Dead with my friend (both of us being deadheads).  So after about 10 minutes or so I went back inside.  When I got on the dance floor, it just went on forever.  It was infinite, never ending, until I saw the DJ and he was at a point that looked like the edge of the plane.  I went up to where he was only to find it went on forever still. I was amazed.  It was like a revalation that went through my body.  I suddenly tied it to the possibilities of life being infinate and ever changing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the dance I met up with my penguin headed friend and headed to the car.  I couldn't stop thinking about the plane, about how it just kept going.  So I got home about 12:00 and went directly to bed.  It took me 20 minutes to do it but i crawled into bed, turned on some Phish, and looked forward to my next experience.\r\n\r\nI told some of my stoner friends about this and they believe that there was definetely something besides weed in the bag I had.  My one friend said Datura, another said PCP.  In any case all I can say is that Marijuana should be legalized because it can truly change you life for the better.\r\n\r\n",

I was so disapointed because there was a school dance that night and I hoped to be stoned for it. So I thought what the hell I'll go have a couple of shots of vodka before I go that'll do the trick.

My friend came to pick me up and couldn't believe how messed up I was.  He kept laughing at me and asking if I was ok.  I was like yeah whatever.

We arrived at his garage and had a beer. Than he pulled out a bowl and a half ounce and started passing it around.  We left after what seemed like 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nWe arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.\r\n\r\nI was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nI woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it.

After about 5 rounds we stopped and sat around for like 10 minutes. One of my friends asked me if I wanted to have a balloon and I did. He filled the balloon with two whippits cartridges. We then went into a dark room which had a bean bag in the corner. I sat on the bean bag and he closed the door. He began to give me a light show by holding a green LED flashlight in each hand. He began making circles and other such patterns by moving his hands and arms really fast. I then exhaled all the air that was in my lungs and brought the balloon to my mouth. I inhaled almost the whole balloon and held it for about 5 seconds. I then began to breath into and out of the balloon slowly and deliberatly. I soon heard the 'helicopter' noise. The noise came on fast but after awhile got slower until it was silent. I do not know if I was still breathing into or out of the balloon at all or even if I was still holding it. As the helicopter noise grew slower and softer my friend's movement got slower until he was completly stopped in time and the 'helicopter' noise had totally frozen. During this whole time my thoughts kept going while it seemed timed had frozen. I felt so comfortable were I was. I thought this was it. I thought I was dead. I was scared, but comfortable were I was. I kept thinking wait... not yet... not yet. Then there was another voice in my head besides my own. It was telling me, 'God knows were you are.' Over and over. I was getting more scared and more scared. Eventually the 'helicopter' noise started back up again, very slowly, and steadily. I then felt so relieved that I was coming back... my friends arms began to move again sychonized with the speed of the helicopter sound as it came back. When I was back I couldn't stop laughing cause I felt so relieved. I've tried several times to get time to freeze again using whippits, but have failed. =(",

Over and over. I was getting more scared and more scared. Eventually the 'helicopter' noise started back up again, very slowly, and steadily. I then felt so relieved that I was coming back... my friends arms began to move again sychonized with the speed of the helicopter sound as it came back. When I was back I couldn't stop laughing cause I felt so relieved. I've tried several times to get time to freeze again using whippits, but have failed. =("

                "text": "Ok I'm not an experienced drug user at all.  I'm 19 years old right now, I tried Marijuana when I was about 15 for the first time, and it didn't work.  I tried it 3 or 4 times after that and it still did not work.  So I just gave up on it.  However, this past weekend some was available and so I decided to try one more time.\r\n\r\nNow even before I begin to get into this experience, I STRONGLY suggest that you surround yourself with a familiar place and familiar people.  I kept up on the people part, but not the place.  So anyway my friends and I went out into the car, did the deed and by the time we got back to the bowling alley (we were driving while smoking) I started to feel the bottom of my feet tingle and my shins were feeling funny too.  I knew I was finally high, and I was excited and happy at the same time.  I was still sitting in the car when this happened so I didn't even know if I was going to be able to walk.  That's how strange it felt.  But of course I was able to and I made my way into the alley (where all my other friends were) with the largest smile on my face ever.  However, that's where the fun ended.\r\n\r\nThe alley was loud and smokey as usual, but my senses were magnifying these aspects 10 times as they normally are.  I felt real uncomfortable so I sat down next to the ball return.  Shaking...shaking...that's all my legs kept doing.  Up and down, up and down, and I could not stop them for the life of me.  Then all of a sudden the strangest thing happened and I know none of you will be able to understand it but it's worth mentioning.  As I was sitting there it seemed like the lanes I was at (Axel Lanes), changed into the old alley in which I used to bowl (Clover Lanes).  It seemed like I was at my old Saturday morning league again, and I was seeing old people that I used to bowl with down a couple lanes farther.  It freaked me out, but it was sort of interesting at the same time. I told my friend Kent what was going on and he smiled, probably thinking that I was a moron or something.  But now it was my turn to bowl.\r\n\r\nEverything was so complicated now.  Getting off the seat, walking to the ball rack, picking the ball up, looking for the holes in the ball, throwing the thing.  What I used to be so fluid and good at, seemed like it took an eternity to do now.  When I picked the ball up the feel of it amazed me.  It was no longer smooth and round; it had a lot of texture to it (I can't remember what kind of texture but it had some for sure).  I then found the finger holes, which seemed to take an hour or so, but then the strangest thing happened again.  The ball felt like it had oil on it, not just a little, I mean a ton of oil.  So much that I was up there slapping the ball and it felt like the oil was splashing on my shirt.  Just an effect of the drug I thought, so I looked up and every lane to my left and right was totally blacked out, I mean not even visible.  There was nothing there on both sides except black space and then my lane in the middle all lit up. I threw the ball, stood an extra second even after it hit the pins, then when I turned around it felt like I was a nazi or some war figure, with the quick heel turn face forward type of thing (this was probably because I saw the movie 'Apt Pupil' the other day before).  When I faced everybody it felt like the whole attention of the bowling alley was on me, and everyone knew I was high.  This made me uneasy and sort of paranoid.  After that everyone I looked at, I was thinking, 'O man she knows I'm high, or he knows I'm high', I don't know why I even cared but I did.\r\n\r\nWell to sum this up, The first time feeling of being high is great no question about it.  I did enjoy being around my friends, but the bowling alley, with so much going on in there, maybe wasn't the best of places to be for the first time. Now I did have this feeling the next couple days of being really stupid, and I couldn't remember short-term memory things (like things that occurred the week before and what not).  However, it went away and was probably just a mind thing.  My only advice to people who are thinking about smoking is to surround yourself with familiar people and familiar surroundings.",

I regard it as a very powerful and religious experience, and thus treat herb with respect.\r\n\r\nThis happened when I lived in Arizona not too long ago. I was walking around the mesa behind my house at about an hour before sundown, enjoying the view of the Earth and open sky. Before I headed home, I decided to smoke a joint I had with me.\r\n\r\nSitting cross-legged in a sandy wash, I smoked most of the joint before deciding to head home. After the intense sensory 'strobing' started, I noticed the small, fine details around me, all the tiny wonders that we usually overlook. The feel of the fine sand, the crisp purity of the desert air, the simple pleasure of watching a lizard dart among the rocks. I had just read the Tao Te Ch'ing, and reflected on the wisdom of the sages in urging us to be more appreciative of the little joys in life.\r\n\r\nAs I walked back down the dirt road that went near my house, the sun setting behind the mesa created a gorgeous mix of red, purple and orange, whose richness I found to be very peaceful. I reflected on the myriad beauty of nature. The small desert plants all around seemed more alive than I had noticed before, and I could hear dogs barking in the distance. I stretched and moved my body in various directions, marveling at the complexity of the human body. To think that mere electrical impulses from the brain could dictate the actions of this vessel! I began to think of the soul, how we fit in with the 'cosmic scheme of things.' I contemplated God, who could surely not be a physical entity. If so, s/he/it would be bound by some laws and forces. I thought of what we know as God to be some universal concentration of incomprehensible energy, directing all things from the scurrying of an ant to the slow, majestic wheeling of galaxies. My body was crude and puny in comparison, relying on material sustenance and physical manifestation. The thought kept recurring through my head 'We Are Machines Compared To God,' as if our idea of 'Organic' pales in comparison to the raw life-essence that is God.\r\n\r\nThe moon was already high and the vivid blue of a Northern Arizona sky framed it perfectly. I stopped and looked around, my eyes tracing the red soil out to the horizon. Standing there, the Earth seemed suddenly vast and wondrous. I could feel through my boots how solid and eternal was the skin of our Mother, how truly great She was. Far off, the Tsaile mountains loomed, the air was still and clear, the Moon was silver and awesome. I began to view the world as some hunter of the steppes must have viewed it in the Pleistocene, as it must have appeared to humans before electricity, before cars, guns, 'civilisation.' All the long centuries of Human existence are but a tiny blip in the life of the Earth and the Sky, which shelter us and whose songs we have forgotten in our modern dedication to money, convenience and noise.\r\n\r\nThe old Australian legends of the Dreamtime gained a newfound sacredness; I could see reflected in the Moon how our ancestors danced beneath her bright face ten thousand years ago in the stillness of the wilderness. All the cycles of life on Earth were perfectly meshed, like threads in a tapestry: even our species' recent trend toward destruction and rape would soon come to an end and we would once more come to love God, the Earth and Each Other.\r\n\r\nI felt very peaceful, serene even; I suspect that if a pair of coyotes had come upon me and decided to rip me to shreds, I would have offered my nourishing body to them, for truly, what is death but a change in worlds, in planes of awareness? The Earth, Sky, Moon were immortal--and so was I. It was a simple, joyous, eternally patient feeling.\r\n\r\nThis was one of my most enlightening voyages into the mind; the sense of Oneness with nature cannot be lost by Us but only forgotten.

                "text": "\nThis incredible occurence of mine occurred around the middle of the first year I began smoking weed.  I was still relatively new to the experience and had only gotten legitimately blazed one time before.  I decided to drop by my friend's house to get just a little high.  Of course, I brought along a little of my own weed, it's just courtesy, but I also knew he had his own little stash, I just didn't know he was growing in his closet!  Well, we rolled most of mine into blunts, and spent 1/2 an hour on them.  As I mentioned, I was relativly new to the experience and everything was new to me.  He put on some Bob Marley and dimmed the lights, I leaned my head back on the couch and closed my eyes, It felt almost as if I was on a roller coaster, but it was moving along with the speed of the song.  My feet felt as if they didn't touch the ground and I sat there for what seemed like hours.\r\n\r\nMy friend woke me from my dream-like state and said something along the lines of, 'You gonna hit it man?' I opened my eyes and he presented me with a blue tinted glass bong and a well packed bowl.  It seems I was only sitting there for several minutes while he packed a bowl into this instrument that was thoroughly foreign to me.  Well, I said he could hit it again, to give me a second because I didn't even know how to use it.  I stared as he hit the bong and the smoke traveled up the odd contraption.  I thought I had it down, and so I decided to brave a hit.  I hit it and kept waiting for my throat to burn as a sigal to slow down, but even as I cleared the carb it was a beautiful flow that felt almost as clean as Oxygen as it passed into my throat.  'Hey guy, slow down on that,' I heard from somewhere around me, I passed it to my friend, I couldn't understand what he said after that.  I listened to the beat of the music and leaned back again.  I returned almost instantly to the roller coaster-type-world and that levitation feeling returned in my feet and eventually captivated my entire body.  'Holy Christ,' I muttered aloud, unaware I was talking, the sound of my own voice was amazing to me and I began mumbling.  I forgot that my friend was even in the room with me.\r\n\r\n'Guy, take another hit on this, then I'll pack again,' He said.  I took hold of the bong and exhaled all of the air in my lungs, then I flicked the lighter and intook all the smoke I could.  I coughed suddenly, and my throat began to burn, one after another the coughs exploded from inside the inner-most core of my body.  I began to lose track of everything around me and my world span.  The roller-coaster world was now surrounding me, and I could feel evey move of it in conjunction with the real world.  It stopped suddenly, and I realized it had only lasted a few seconds, I felt amazing, like I could do anything.  He said I could clear it, so with pleasure I did just that.  I got the cool air feeling again, and wondered what went wrong last time.  To this day I still do not know.\r\n\r\nI passed the bong and gazed at the curling smoke,  I looked beyond it, to a world where everything was made of the smoke and I was part of it, I was floating with it, and then he passed it to me again.  This went on for what seemed like all night but in reality was only about an hour and a half.   When he was fresh out of bud, I do not know, I just know that eventually the bong stopped coming to me and I fell into this amazing trance where it seemed as though the music was a part of me and it was swirling around me and I could have never felt better in my whole life.  From there the effects gradually decreased, my rollercoaster stopped and I eventually returned to my normal state of consciousness.  To this day I doubt I've ever reached a high so full as that, and I can hardly wait till the day it is upon me again.",

After finishing the joints we decided to go back into the house where it was warm and comfortable. After about 10 minutes, I began to feel disapointed; I was  not the least bit high.\r\nI walked upstairs into a dark room and turned on a lava lamp. The second my eyes hit the lamp I felt this huge surge of energy shoot through my body. It was very unexpected but felt great none the less. My overwhelmed body collapsed to the floor. My legs and arms began to move every-which way as I lay on my back gigling. I had no control...NONE. Then, as sudenly as they began, my muscle spasms stoped. I was curious as to how much time had past since I walked into the room. I stared at my indeglo watch. Instead of the usual #'s, I saw strange lines moving up and down the face of my watch. For some strange reason this didn't surprise me at all. \r\n\r\nThen my friend walked into the room and suggested that we turn on the strobe light. Having tripped out on that thing before, I agreed. He turned it on, slow at first. I picked up a small baseball and threw it up in the air. It seemd to suspend in the air for several seconds before comming back down into my hands.I got such a kick out of it, that I kept on just throwing the ball up and down for about 10 minutes. My friend then turned the strobe light to fastmode. I put it up to my face and looked directly into it (never do that...very bad for eyes). I saw the rear view of a space ship as it made its way through space. Then my friends bro walked in and sprayed cold water in my face with a water pistol. this caused me to immediately lose my high.\r\n\r\nThis was a very interesting trip from which I learned two things: \r\n1)A lava lamp and a small dark room make an excellent combo.\r\n2)Sometimes a high kicks in relatively late, so be ready.",
