I grew my first batch of shrooms this year. Someone had bought a pack of herbal (extacy) cigarettes. The smokes were bunk, but I had a thought; since I had my shrooms in storage for a rainy day, why not put a chunk of a small shroom in one of these cigs? So that's what I did. I didn't exactly trip out, but I felt that seclusiveness you feel around those who arent tripping when you are. The street lights took on a shroomy hue and I felt glad that it was summertime and I had no job. I was coherrent but happy. All in all, still a good experience.
