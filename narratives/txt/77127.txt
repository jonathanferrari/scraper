Psychotic Episode From Cannabis

Cannabis is one of the most enjoyable drugs, but it is not completely harmless. One night, I was smoking a lot. I had a very happy day and thought, '**** it I'm gunna smoke my heart out...' I smoked 3 grams of bong hits in a total of 30 minutes. I just kept packing bowls, turned up the Zeppelin playing, and tried to get as blazed as I've ever been.

After smoking 3 grams in bong hits... As you can imagine I was flying. I was singing along to Pink Floyd songs, laughing at nothing, just having a good time. Then it started...

Suddenly a strange feeling overcame me. I started to drift away from the pleasant high I was having, and started to get mentally uncomfortable. I felt like I was having a bad trip, although there was nothing in the world that could stop me! Nothing was even bothering me. I started to feel like it wasn't me inside of my head... I looked at the mirror, and wondered if it was me inside of my head. Every time I looked into a mirror at myself it would send tingles down my spine. 

I ignored it and tried to get back to a good trip. I started packing more bowls, and I started to notice, when I would talk to myself, like just saying 'damn Im gunna get wrecked from this hit!' , I wouldn't say I... I was saying 'we' when I was talking about myself... I would say 'oh we're gunna get blazed' and I'm thinking... Who is we? It was like I started developing a different personality in my head. At this point I started getting scared. 

I felt like I was being taken over by insanity, and that this other person in my head was trying to gain control. This feeling continued until the high ended...

Never in my life have I ever experienced a moment where I literally was scared of going insane. I still smoke marijuana and enjoy it very much. 

I don't think I have any mental illnesses, although my family has a history of it (mothers side). But it always makes me wonder...
