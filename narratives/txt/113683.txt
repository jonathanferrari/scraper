I tried The Pink One's Kickass Mushroom Tea Recipe (it was delicious....seriously) only 1 time and used all I had acquired...3.5 mg approx. It may be too much? Was only optical effects and delirium at my sitters looking deformed hahaha. But being a Clusterhead and doing some trying out research, it gave me a huge hangover after that 90 minutes when you can eat again, so that wasn't really a succes. But I admit not looking into the dosage and microdosing nothing. Just did it. 

So that's what it was, an experience. Blessed I am to be episodic, last episode was exactly 2 years ago, the cycle ended on the 19th of this month, after having started on August 30th, 2017. O2 is my miracle...:)

I does bring me to the comorbidities of being a ClusterHead since the age of 20 and I am 54 now. The PTSD is extremely link to that condition. But I don't want to go there, as a Veteran, I have a story of itself in that regards. 

All that to say that I am studying alot on microdosing 1P-LSD. Now we're starting to be hopefull...:)
