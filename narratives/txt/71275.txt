Its white, clean
pebble-size paper,
dry against unsure toungue.
Time passes hazily
(Time.
 uhh...
 what's that?)
Gravity's 
stone-breathed shutter 
pulls green 
into blue.
blazing leaf geommetry riding
the ripples of collision, 
smells like light 
at night
sounds like air in space.
oh, hello, Sun.
How are youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.............
Answer at once, shine dances penetrating
through your little dome of ecstasy
Laughter flows upwards
bathing heavy brain with joy.
Eyes close. 
Patterns frolic seamlessly across eyelids,
emerging from the breathing migration of patterns are 
bright beams bursting into the mind.
Eyes wide.
Sun's final secrets ride 
the sky red 
kissing the trees
standing quietly.
I stand.
Walking...
towards some unknown future.
Still riding the blissful seafoam of an acid brain.
