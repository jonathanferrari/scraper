Well I started out late in life with drugs but I have use weed, shrooms, meth (Twice), and salvia. I was in a bad marrige when I decided to try mesceline. 
                                                                                                                                                                                       The day when my foot long piece of san pedro came and started preparing it by the pretty standard recipe. So I downed half the glass of the nasty liquid and waited. About 20 min I had trailers and the walls looked like they was breathing. 1 hour later I was fully tripping. There was a lame movie on but I had no motivation to move just lie on the couch and laugh for no reason. The visuals when I shut my eyes was intense like kaleidoscope of colors and patterns that was ever changing. 8 hours of just feeling great and laughing. 

The experience was great and will do mesceline again. The situation I was in with my marriage didn't even damper the experience with mesceline.
