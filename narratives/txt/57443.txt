##EROWID_NOTE:HIGH_DOSE##

I have taken LSD several times, usually between 2 and 4 'hits'.  With this particular batch, I felt the hits were fairly potent.  I decided to take 9 in my dorm room.  (5 days ago, I had taken 4 hits, so I probably had a light tolerance built up)

The experience was similar to a 4-hit trip, except the visual hallucinations were more vivid, perhaps more synthetic(?)  Far more interesting for me was the audio.  I had not noticed it until a good 5 hours or so into the trip.  I heard a faint creaking in my mind, sort of like rapid pulses of sound like a modem noise over the telephone.  I found that as I concentrated on this noise, playing it up in my mind, it grew louder.  I could hear distortions of this sort of 'data stream' noise analogous to the settings in an audio program such as Pro Tools or Sound Forge (modulation, frequency, wow-flutter).  Very bizarre and very cool.

Up until this point, I had doubted the notion that LSD could produce auditory hallucinations greater than the sort of 'whirr' that accompanies most serotogenic trips of mine.  Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room.  I tend to view LSD as the most natural-feeling of the 'synthetic' hallucinogens - however, the sounds I heard reminded me more of the synthetic character of, say, 2ci.
