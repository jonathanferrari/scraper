When smoking weed, I get this mind blowing feeling that the world, Universe and everything is a dream and I am trapped inside it. Trapped in a reality which isnt real. I think I get this idea out of my unconscious knowing that there are no true answers to why reality exist. This feeling leads to anxiety and I have always gotten a bad trip.
