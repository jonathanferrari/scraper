Dose was prepared by steeping the mushrooms in water for about 30 minutes, pouring the water into cups, then adding honey.  This is my favorite way to ingest them, because I don't really taste the shrooms.  Each cup was estimated to have 1/16 oz.; I didn't even finish my cup and I still had a good trip. 

Effects started faster than usual, after about 15 minutes I started noticing 'life' popping up everywhere.  The christmas ornaments started looking at me, some evil, some good.  I went outside and noticed they trees.  They 'told' me the only way they could talk/move was through wind.  I noticed some 'gnomes' (about the size of garden gnomes) that were hidden in the bark of a neighbor's tree. Each blade of grass was alive, beaming as the sun beat off them.  In the foreground of a sunset, a leaf spiraled to the ground, and I realized that life abounds in everything, from the macro to the micro.  Even the birds that were painted on the thermostat were alive.  This energy/lifeforce told me that all you had to do was notice it and smile back.

This trip was the realization of a quote from the St. Thomas gospel: 'I am the light that is over all things....Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.'  It was beautiful.
