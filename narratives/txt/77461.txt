I used X while I was at a rave, at the time it was the best feeling I've ever felt, but, now I greatly regret it, ever since I took it, 2 weeks ago, it has made me very depressed, and has also been the cause of me worrying excessively about things, 

I also have found myself crying for unexplained reasons and have never felt this bad before, I just hope it will get better and that people reading this will have an effect on their decision to take ecstasy.
