Life turned into a beautiful cartoon and everything had a slight orange hue to it.  I was listening to The Beatles and the music began to bend a little I guess you could say distort.  Everything was colorful geometric shapes.  I turned to my boyfriend and he looked so amazing.  His dreads looked like cartoon colored lightening bolts coming from his head.  

When I was able to speak and remembered I could move I said 'Holy Shit!'  It was so awesome and I felt nothing but joy.  I saw the world go totally fucking crazy.
