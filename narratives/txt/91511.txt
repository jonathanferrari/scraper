Shrooms brought me to hell. I had decided to go on a first experience psilocybin trip. After ingesting the whole bag in a couple bites with some sunny d to wash it down. The taste of the substance reminded me of yeast. I was at the forest with a friend and smoked some more reefer to ease the difficulty of such an experience. As I was walking back to the car I was definitely in touch with a universal truth that is yet understood. When my friend dropped me off I had a strong time getting out of the car. Once I finally did I thought I was disappearing into nature, in my vision I seen half parts of my friends arm like it wasn't there. I had visions of being sent to hell and face my fears in eternity. I had other visions of me being the pray and being eaten by a demon. I was stopped in the street by someone who asked me what I had done! He ended up sitting under a tree talking to me about the meaning of shrooms. Thinking to myself the trip of all trips last forever in eternity. I prayed to the lord to guide my way, and ended up leaving the hospital later that day.
