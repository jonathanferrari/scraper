Had a bad trip this morning. Very strong dose (still feeling slight effects 14 hours later) that led to panic attack and an emergency room visit for some Atavan to calm down. It worked well.

I was NOT with a trusted sitter/friend. Mistake. I did it on an empty stomach. Mistake. (It hit hard and fast.)

Ugh, I'm done with LSD. People like me with a history of panic attacks should be not be taking drugs this strong.
