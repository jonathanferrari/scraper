I had done weed, xtc, speed and coke before, but this night me and my friends would try Mexican Mushrooms which we bought from the local smart-shop.

We all took 1 bag which contained 3 dried mushrooms, and about twenty minutes after that, I started laughing. I couldn't do anything else but laugh, and when I tried to explain myself to my friends, I barely could speak the first part of the first word I wanted to say without starting to laugh again...

Tears rolled from my eyes from laughing, and I guess 30 minutes after I took the shrooms, I started to see lights bend, the curtains that hung from the window started to move, and when I looked down at the floor sitting in a couch, I saw that the floor was at a higher level than normal.

Really EVERYTHING I looked at from that moment moved, or didn't look normal. The TV was on, and the hair on the actor's heads was moving all out of proportion, and when they talked it seemed like the sound came just a second too late every time a sentence was said.

We turned on some music after that, and I lied down, closing my eyes, curious if I would see strange patterns or something, and of course I definitely did...

After about 2,5 hours or so, I started to get tired of not being able to speak normally, and not being able to see things normally, and the bad thing was, the trip only got more intense....

After (I guess) 5 or 6 hours, things started to get normal again, and I was exhausted.... 

Looking back to my experience, I know that this one was the most intense of all drugs I took, (never did the Acid or other visual drugs) and the only real down-point for me is that the trip was too long, I really wanted to have a normal conversation after a few hours, and that was impossible at the time....
