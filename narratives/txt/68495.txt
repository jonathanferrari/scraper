Out of Body Experience

While in a powerhouse club I was sat down waiting to come up on the two MDMA pills I took.  When it hit me, I was crying and looking at my friends with one of those rare 'this is going to be the best night of my life' expressions.

Later I was bouncing to the music, kicking it on the balcony area with a couple of girls on either side, we had come together through the music and I remember smiling at them and they looked at me, frowned and moved away.  My friends girlfriend came up to me and said that the muscles on one side of my face had collapsed so I guess I was freaking people out.

I moved round the balcony area to a darker area to resolve this and continued to enjoy the dancing, kicking and skipping in a timeless moment.  

Then my vision went black and white, I was floating up to the ceiling with my arms out wide, smiling beautifully.  There were other dancers up there with me, in the same position, arms wide and smiling too.  The music had faded away into the distance.   This continued for a few minutes and just faded out and I was back in the club, the music coming back and I simply carryed on dancing like before.
