Back from the grave,
Reborn again.
Don't know how to behave,
Don't know how it began.

In total confusion,
Where I lay.
Lifes an illusion,
A game I play.

Dazed and confused,
I look at the ceiling.
My minds been abused,
But I just love the feeling.

The ceiling is twirling,
The walls only pulse.
The carpet is curling,
But I know its all false.

Stuck in a world,
Parallel to mine.
The colors all swirled,
A vision benign.

I roam around,
Unable to speak.
Falling off the ground,
As I reach my peak.
