Last year I had a habit of driving up to a remote area near my University to smoke cannabis [strain: Thunderfuck] listen to music and look at the Turkey Vultures soar over the cow pastures. Getting stoned up at foothill was indeed my very favorite thing to do. In fact I did it about twice a day and though I would not admit it at the time I was addicted to cannabis. The following mind bending experience is just one example of why I was such a pothead.

I am a composer of avant-garde (music that is super trippy when stoned off your gourd) classical music and sometimes I would turn off the music and listen to the sound of the wind and the cicadas. One week I took a break from smoking cannabis so that the next time I smoked the experience would be ultra intense. So I toked up at the end of that week with high expectations. I was not disappointed.

It seems to me that THC must intensify hearing because after I finished smoking I began to notice a relationship between the sound of the wind and the rhythmic patterns of the cicadas. As the full effects of the Thunderfuck began to take hold I started to make some sounds with my voice, which to my amazement were in relationship to the polyrhythmic chirping of the cicadas. Soon it seemed to me that it was perfectly obvious that I had somehow gained telepathic communication with the cicadas and was now directing their chorus with my voice. The vocal improvisation lasted until my voice gave out but I continued to observe the sound of the cicadas and felt a deep connection with them and my surroundings.

I've since had to quit smoking cannabis due to the fact that it seems to have induced mental illness (schizoaffective disorder) in me twice.
