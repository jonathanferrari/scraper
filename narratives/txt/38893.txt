I had just been fired from my job, and I was not in a very great mood.  I knew that my friend had more shrooms than he knew what to do with, so I made a call and got 2 grams of dried mushrooms for 20 bucks.

When I got them, I noticed that there was a lot more stem in the bag than the last time I bought them from the same guy.  I'm not sure how much this really changes the effects of the drug, but I certainly was NOT in for a surprise.

About 1.5 hours after eating them, the only effects I got were the occasional laugh out of the blue, but that was it.  There was literally NO auras around lights or anything that describes as a medium dose, which I assumed I had taken.

I have brought from this guy before, and his stuff is always good, we have been friends for a while, so I know he wouldn't cheat me, but this certainly was not worth the 20.  It felt like I had taken a few hits from some decent weed, that's it.  My pupils were dilated almost to the edge, but there were no other physical signs.

It might be worth noting that I had eaten a breakfast sandwich from my work, dunkin donuts, a few hours before, but certainly nothing significant.  Overall, I think I may need to take over double this dose next time to get any significant effects.
