First Experience With Psychedelics (Threshold)

I took 0.75 g dried (not cracker-dry, slightly bendy stems) Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata. I chopped them finely, put them in a tea diffuser, added ginger and diffuser to cup, poured boiling water over top, let them steep 10 minutes, added 2 Yogi tea bags (caffeine-free) and steeped an additional 5 min. 

Set and setting: At home, first 45 minutes or so I spent in the backyard. Went inside when I got bored, went for a walk around the neighborhood after an hour or so. I was in a good mood. My boyfriend was sitting me and I felt safe. 

My effects were very slight, and I was never sure whether or not they actually kicked-in. 

Subjective effects: I felt like I noticed small details of things more than I normally. I saw a small insect and watched it for about 5 minutes, examining it carefully. My mind almost felt foggy.  No changes in colors or visuals. My mind stayed about normal

Objective effects: I was slightly more chatty and was quicker to laugh at things. I had a nice belly laugh at a political sign in someone's yard I thought was funny.
