I got dmt for the first time a couple months back and was pretty excited. I smoke weed drink and sometimes do mushys but I heard this shit was great. Me and a few buddies went up to a sand pit and started smoking the dmt. I smoked 10 mg of it.  Within 5 seconds of my hit it was like a train hit my brain and all the trees above me circled together. This was the most intense high I have ever gotten. I just sat there and watched the sky move quickly and the sand was fading into shades of red. After it wore off about 15 minutes in, I blew the other dose. This was a much more enjoyable high as the peak snuck up on me, and it didn't freak me out nearly as much. I felt amazing and the trip was about 45 minutes long. I watched the sky for what felt like hours and loved every minute of it. Coming down is amazing as well, its like a 2 hour body high.
