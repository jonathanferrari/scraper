Before starting the report, I'd like to say that I dont have a very advanced english, so sorry about that.

Friday night, around 9pm, I was hanging out with friends, playing gta 5 and smoking some cigarretes, pretty chill, so we decided is was a good idea to meet with a friend who had cannabis, before we left the house We drinked some vodka, I drank 1 big shot, all my friends drank the same, and we left.

We reached this friend house around 10:35 pm and before started smoking, we had a beer, I almost drank it all myself, then we started smoking. I smoked 2 big hits of a very low quality weed (I'm from Argentina and having dank buds its extremely expensive, normally we smoke this thing we call 'prensado'). It took around 2 minutes to hit. 

10 minutes after it hit I was totally baked, barely could walk, and only could only say around 3 words, I think its important to say that I dont smoke regularly and I have a really low tolerance to THC, however this never happened to me, at the moment I was feeling extremely paranoid and my thoughts were very slow. I had to stop to rest a little bit on every block, it was imposible to walk in a straight line. My friends were helping me to walk, we had to walk around 25 blocks to reach my home. 

All my memories after we started walking just dissapeared, I remember I asked the hour a couple times, first time I asked it was 10:50, second time it was 12:35 am. My time perception was really distorted, and I dont know exactly why it took us so long to reach my home. When we reached my home I said goodbye to my friends and entered my home, I could not fucking describe how beautifull it was to throw myself to bed, all the paranoia was gone, it was all solved, it was beautiful. I eat something and sleeped feeling like god. 

The morning after I was still really buzzy, and wondering why the fuck 2 hits of a low quality joint hit me that much.
