I've tripped about four times before and each was beautiful and strange in it's own way. I have been trying to find shrooms in my area for about a year and when a friend told me about some I bought an 1/8 without hesitation. I took the day off of work today and at 7:35 a.m. Est I ingested the 1/8 (on an empty stomach). I have no problem with the taste at all.

At around ten past 8 I started to feel a body buzz and the walls began to breath a little but that subsided after a few moments. I then laid back to relax for the come up. The come up was a little bit awkward but the body buzz was really good and I had a feeling of euphoria. After about 20 minuets I put on my headphones and began listening to the song 'rubber world' by local syracuse band Ted Eddison. They are incredible. Anyway, I definately experienced the time dilation thing as mere moments of the song seemed like entire episodes or events. I can't really say that I experiences closed eye visuals, but I had these strange and lovely daydream experiences. I have vivid daydreams anyway, but these were tinged with colorfull psychedelic accents. I felt a split in my self at times. Part of me felt completely sober while another part was free to play and daydream. I realized that this wasn't entirely true as I got up to go to the bathroom and every time I saw my reflection in the mirror I thought 'this fucking guy again.' Whenever I had that thought I would chuckle. The effects subsided a bit around 10 am. I listened to 'inward journey: east and west' by Joseph Campbell. It was enlightening and funny at times.

It's now 11:19 am and I am coming down gently. I still have a happy buzzy feeling and music still sounds trippier. Overall it was a very mellow trip and I had a great time. I will do it again maybe in 6 months or so.
