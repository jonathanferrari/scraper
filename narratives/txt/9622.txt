I found and identified via spore print some Gymnopilus spectabilis mushrooms in a patch of woods near my home in the northern plains. I knew that the shrooms had some entheogenic value in Europe and had no DEADLY lookalikes here so I tried and experienced. Experience I did. They had an eye-opening effect that was more of the mood-altering kind than visual. They had light visuals and worked great with beer and buddha.


These honeys are different from the usual psilocybes in that they seemed to be activated by a person's saliva. With experimentation I realized that the longer I held the shroom tween my cheek and gum (even in small amounts), the sunnier the day became. Although they only lasted 15 or so minutes, they were reinforced both by dose taken and potential dosage.

At last an easy to ID shroom ( the color of most gyms is unmistakeable) that is quite possibly LEGAL! I'm not the chemist of the bunch but these treats appear to have different 'personality' than psilocybes. Even the flavor, although bitter, was enjoyably interesting. To boot, they were absolutely gregariuos in their chosen location.

If you happen to POSITIVELY ID gymnopilus (any of the four) remember to treat them like chewing tobacco when ingesting. Happy dayz!
