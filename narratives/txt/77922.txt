There I was

White powder

Lights off

Bed made

I lit the lighter

The powder quickly became oil

The oil seeped into the wool

1
2
3
can I do it???

Yes I can I take the 4th cottony hit

4 Large hits through a bong

I hit the pillow

Impossible visions

I remember

Entities say hi

They say goodbye 

I am waking up

Reality is becoming clear again

DMT hyperspace is folding back into the 3d world I'm used to.

I'm being reborn.

Now I remember who I am.


But I forget how it feels to breakthrough

I forget about the impossabilitys.

And on my life goes

Load, Light, Toke, Remember, Forget.
