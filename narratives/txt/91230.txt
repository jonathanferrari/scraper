First Time

I had never really been in to any kind of drugs at that age but when a friend of a friend brought it up I felt compelled to take some hits. Being my first time my tolerance was low, and I coughed a couple of times.The effects came within 5-10 minutes of the last bowl. It came as my body feeling lighter almost but I still felt gravity holding me down. It felt like I was in a dream by how everything was somewhat comical and how me moving was so fluid. While skating home the wind only made me feel better. There was no fear and I could only say this is probably how I would feel if I were at complete peace with yourself.
