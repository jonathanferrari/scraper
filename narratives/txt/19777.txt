A freind and I, whom I will address as d, were sitting around going over ideas for a current sound project we have been experimenting with. And out of nowhere he pulls out a couple grams of ketamine. I was somewhat siked, seeing I havent had an expeience with this substance in a little over a year, to be able to project myself once again in to that world of understanding. 

We each progressively dosed ourselves bump by bump over a period of 60 minutes, waiting 5 to 10 minutes between each and eventually we looked at each other and realized where we were. Looking around at all of lighting, I was amazed by the signifigance of the color variations that were occuring. My mind felt as though it were floating away from my body, and at the same time my body felt as if gravity was pulling it down, further and further. My sense of time was also fairly distorted, a period of 20 minutes seemed to last an hour or so. Another interesting occurence was sound, as we sat back and let the ketamine work its magic the melvins played wonderously in the backround as the song held me in its grasp. There I was, right there at that certain point in time, visualizing some of the many happenings in fast motion from my astral mind perception. Everything seemed to be flowing through in, through out, as I felt great forms of energy surging through the universe, at a certain point I felt as though I was being regenerated in another part, on another side of what seems to be happening here. 

All in all the experience was very pleasurable, and hopefully sometime, k and I will meet again in that place of understanding.
