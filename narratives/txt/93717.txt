I've experienced dmt many times every one was awesome and very real. I could never describe in words exsactly what has happened to me but I can try. I am much more of a person I feel like I know everything in reality like it fits together like a puzzle. As of my last experience I saw a creator and many other things but the creator was what I think of god I can remember there was an endless building blocks of something that looked like dna except that it wasn't in the same shape this was just growing everywhere infront of me I saw the possibilities of my future I went through time and space and I never used to believe in time. I heard this noise almost the whole time unexplainable. But I think it might have been space time and me going warp speeds. I feel like I am one complete thing like I'm not really me like I'm just a doll filled with light. But I don't mind because I know that there are way greater things going on besides my life. Its funny to me how obvious everything is and how little we know about ourselves I guess I could be crazy but the truth is that everyone is.  just one a little more or less than the next. 

I will say that as much dmt has done good for me some bad has come with it. Unfortunately I know way to much about myself and everything around me even though I have this feeling of being able to do almost anything on earth I want I have become to lazy because I know I truly don't have to and prob because I smoke mad buds but whatev. I believe dmt can unlock many many doors into the matter of life,death,berth,spacetime,energy,creators,and destroyers, I hope someone out there reads and learns from this if it was even any good.
