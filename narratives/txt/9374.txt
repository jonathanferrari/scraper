I tripped on homegrown Psilocybe cubies the night before I smoked the mushrooms, the trip was stellar. I had slept for 9 hours afterwards and hadn't smoked any cannabis all day (nor done any other drugs), and being out of cannabis I wanted to get high, so I figured I would try smoking some mushrooms. I packed a bubbler full of mushrooms, which I packed in there tight. My girlfriend and I smoked up the whole bowl, it tasted disgusting, but... not all drugs taste good. It tasted sort of like burning hair and cheese, almost enough to make me nauseous. After smoking the shrooms, I felt a little elevated and put on some cartoons. I think I would've felt more high, but, I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth. I drank a soda, ate some cookies, and finally decided to brush my teeth and use Listerine -- which helped. But, by the time I finished all that -- My buzz had worn off, this was about 20 minutes later. 

My conclusion -- I won't smoke any more cubies. I woke up with the taste in my mouth too, and it really bothered me. Maybe if you smoke them, you'll want to mix it with some MJ or something to give some flavor, and maybe ease the buzz up. Anyways, I still don't recommend it.
