11:11pm Make a wish. Dropped the tab [1 acid tab ungrateful dead]. 

11:47 pm I thought I wasn't feeling anything but my neck feels odd. I almost feel very lightly nauseous but I know it will pass I think its because I didn't eat much before only pizza about 5 hours ago. My hand eye coordination is staring to lag as noticed from typing on the computer and talking to a friend. 

11:58 pm Pupils larger. Feeling weirder. Starting 2 trip.

12:09 am The ear thing. (whooshing)

12:17 am Done texting. Time to let go. Hard to type. I just feel weird. Everything is on a slant.

12:19 am Hearing and seeing trails if that makes sense. Hyper aware. Slipping further into it. Pupils dilated. I can't tell if I have to pee or not lol.

12:29 am Woahh its only been 10 minutes lol. I'm deff tripping now. Grinding my teeth a lot. 

12:43 am Staring the movie 'Waking Life'. Tired of electronics.

2:38 am 'Waking Life' was intense. Really hungry I wish I could sort that. I'm surprised I can type. Everything is moving in little circles. Trying to play 'Grand Theft Auto' now. Really super sensitive to all the ambient music this thing makes. Everything is melting like in 'Waking Life' loll. 

4:06 am Starting to come down. Pupils still very large. 

4:46 am Still grinding teeth, ears still keen on music and my 'Dream Sequens' by NMESH cassettes. I wish it wasn't almost 5am. I have to remind myself I can get it again. Watching Prevue Guide clips and smoking weed. 

5:52 am Staring into the mirror I somehow became third person. For a second my audio and visual seemed completely static "I became the reflection" somehow I became the moment I saw the reflection of myself in the mirror and I became the reflection staring back for a second.

I did some more dabs and peacefully drifted off to sleep around 7am or so.
