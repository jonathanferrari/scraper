My drug use tends to consist of marijuana and alcohol. However, I have experimented with other drugs. I have tried LSD twice and yes I believe the experience has permanently changed the way I think but it seems to be more positive than negative. I used to have very little to say and now I am more outgoing and able to form closer relationships. I also became more impulsive from it. I am also more orgasmic now. This is going to sound weird because I have never heard this mentioned when reading about LSD but it left me slightly turned on with a tingly sensation in my crotch. This has helped me enjoy sexual experiences more than in the past. The experience has also left me more aware of my soul and not just my body.

Now I should mention here that their were initially adverse reactions. I was so nervous about what to expect the first time I tried the drug that I had a panic attack which made the initial part of the trip scary. The attacks did come back here and there but I was able to talk myself into staying calm because I knew I wasn't really dying. It has dissipated anyway over time.I never needed medication for this because I just needed to train myself to stop thinking about it. I was also a little uncomfortable with the change in my thought processes for a little while but once I got used to it I was able to see the benefits. Occasionally I see a transparent shade of blue in the upper part of my visual field but I find it comforting.

I guess the result of the experience is up to the individual. I could have freaked and said 'What has happened to me?' However, people can change from doing marijuana too. I think psychedelics are beneficial but I am careful about abusing them because they are powerful.
