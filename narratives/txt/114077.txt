First Edible in Years

My friend had obtained a large quantity of weed from a relative as well as multiple edibles.  He threw me a chocolate and said to me that edibles didn't work for him so I could have one for free since he had no use for it.  That night I decided to only eat half since my main rule is to start slow since I've had a low tolerance and have never been able to gain a tolerance.  

I took the edible a few hours later and put on some YouTube, fell asleep and woke up feeling very high about 2 hours later.  During the duration I couldn't get my leg to stop shaking.  I went to the washroom, and realized my sister was still awake but didn't come into contact with her (thank god).

Shortly after I went back to my room, calmed down and put on some porn and whatnot.  About 4 hours later I finally came down and fell asleep.  Woke up at about 12 the following morning feeling slightly off, but that wore off in about 30 minutes.
