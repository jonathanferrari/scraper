Experience and After Effects

I was very nervous on my first experience of MDMA; my stomach was tight, my palms sweaty and I could feel my heart racing.
 
I took half a pill thinking that it contained 60 mg which was proven to be much more than that (I heard that one pill can include up to 300 mg).  I was in a quite peaceful environment and everything felt great. It kicked in very slowly, and slowly it went. Touching my skin or any other fabric felt great. I personally loved the pressure in my fingers.  I felt happy, peaceful, talkative etc. 

The next day I felt energetic, still very happy and quite relieved (''that was it? It was great!'')

Only side effect- I bit my cheek from jaw clinging and now I can't properly chew. Also, after 2 days, I noticed a physical exhaustion but nothing abnormal (just had a long long nap).

Today, day 5, I had a very sudden dizziness that blurred my visual field (as if stopping after spinning around myself for minutes). I do not imply correlation, just saying it may be the MDMA.
