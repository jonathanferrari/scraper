Insufflated Freebase

First effects manifested at 15 minutes, growing in intensity until 45 minutes, then reluctantly tapering off until about the hour point. In a million words disguised as a science fiction story gone paranoid, I could attempt to describe the typical (?) tryptamine buzz, but I just can't. This was too weird. 

The experience does not fit neatly into the good or bad bin: it was a little of both. Hold on, no it wasn't; IT WAS A LOT OF BOTH! I can reach the room of dreams this way. But I cannot leave as quickly. And I know if I fight a tryptamine, it will beat me senseless (I had a headache afterwards and it was fun to think that my pineal had been knuckled like a speed-bag).

It was interesting not being thrown into outerspace. It was interesting having more than 5 seconds to wonder before being ripped from the birth of reaction into the action. It was also a little scary. DMT is really a very strange thing. Whatever it is, it is full of power, and it likes to show off.

Here is the best way to share the gift of what I have been given. It's in a simple word- WOW!
