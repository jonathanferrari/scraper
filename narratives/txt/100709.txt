First Time Xtcy Experience

I took the the tab when I knew I had the full day off.  It was a quiet relaxing day.  I played peaceful new age music.  

After an hour I began to feel very mellow.  Thoughts came to mind about graduate work in philosophy -- feeling that I was one with all and the authors. I got up the courage to get a pop on the main floor of my building.  I ran into two ladies I knew.  I found myself hugging them.  They were quite responsive.  For several hours I had feelings of oneness with the universe, and felt peaceful and relaxed.  I felt as though I could have slept, but didn't want to as I felt so rested and at ease.  

After five hours of ingestion, I felt the effects diminish.  I slept a solid 8 hours, although I have suffered from insomnia my whole life.  I felt no effects the next day, other than feeling relaxed.  I did, I should add, drank about five glasses of water, and a pop, to stay hydrated.  

The experience changed my perception of reality.  I now know that it is our purpose on this planet to love, and to act with loving-kindness.  Little things matter, as we are all one.

I am not a 'quack!'  LOL.  I have a doctorate in the sciences.
