I had a bottle of liquid ketamine, fresh out of the vets office, and also an insulin syringe. I filled the syringe to the '60' mark and injected it intermuscularly, right in my bicep. 

At first I felt a little flighty, kind of like a weed-high, and I turned on the TV. A couple of minutes later I had a total head-change, the room was spinning total hallucinations of about everything you can imagine. It was insane. Then I had an overwhelming feeling of being alone, and of dying. I didn't know what to do I was totally convinced that I was going to die alone in my bedroom. Then I vomited all over the floor. I then spoke to God, not in a prayer mind you, but actually had a conversation with God, white light and everything. Then soon passed out on the bed.

Overall it was a mindbending experience I feel very enlightened by it. If I was to give anyone advice I would say not to eat anytime before taking it, and to NOT DO IT ALONE!
