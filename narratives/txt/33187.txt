Doing Mushrooms Alone

I am writing this because I know that many people who either enjoy mushrooms or want to try them are afraid to do them alone.  By doing them alone I really get to feel the full effect of the psilocybin. I like to have some stuff ready to do while tripping. Such as music and posters and things of that sort.Also a good idea is to have a friends phone number on hand so I can call them so they can calm me down.

The experience that I had when I was alone was the best I have ever had on mushrooms. (I have done them 3 times). I took them around 10:30 at night and they began to kick in around 11. My parents (I'm 16 by the way) were asleep by then so I was free till the morning. Right away I went to my basement and put on some music. This is what I have to play so I do not begin to tweak. When I listened to music, which was phish, (this might confuse people), I heard the music going the normal speed yet I heard every note hit by the guitar, bass, keyboard, and drums like it was playing in slow motion. I have always had a deep love for music and the bands that create in, but after this happened it tripled. I would have never experienced that if I was with other people. I am way beyond glad that I took them by myself.
