I first took the hit in front of the mirror. I went out of the bathroom and held it under my tongue for about 30 minutes then swallowed. I started looking up at the ceiling and saw bugs gathering around the ceiling fan. The patterns on the ceiling looked really intricate like a top-notch old western painting. I knew it was just the Christmas lights reflecting off of the tree. I took LSD for my first and last time that day. It was Christmas break and everybody else took more hits than me so it was like they were in a different world. I wanted to be alone so I went out to my car and when everybody else got in I thought they were trying to set me up. I knew that they were my friends but I just wanted to trip by myself, as I though that was the best way to trip so that I didn't have any distractions.

While I was in my car I stayed up the whole night from 11pm to 12am and went to work while I was coming down. I made pizza and that was the easiest job to trip while I am working. During that time in my car I lost half of my ego. I thought that I turned into somebody else and I had to tell all of my friends that I wasn't really human. I believe that is the true feeling of dying. I turned into something else other than an earthly body. My soul carries on. People may think that the reasoning behind LSD is to seduce people. But the true good trips are those that make one loose their ego and bring one back down to reality. Reality is just an finite spec in time.

LSD is the whole universe thrown into a drug.
