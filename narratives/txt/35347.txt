(This is not a report, but a short poem and personal tribute to the shrooms...)

Dearly departed from this lower state of consciousness
On the empyreal journey of this psychedelic catalyst...

The Flesh of the Gods
The Ambrosia of lore
The forbidden fruit of Eden
My pansophical Mentor

Just one taste of your provision
And we are left with such cognition...

To learn the canticles of time unfurled
To break the manacles of this corrupted world
To see the lies of the 'wise'
To your creed, we shall concede...

Through the ingestion of your suggestion we are temporarily freed...

Thank you...
