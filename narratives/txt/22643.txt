Alright, some friends of mine had some acid that they were selling for 7 bucks a hit. I'd never tried it but I knew of 3 or 4 other people who had tried this same acid batch and they had told me that it was pretty good so I bought a tab. It was on a little piece of paper about 1/8 of a postage stamp or maybe even smaller than that, with a little blue dot on it. I put it on my tongue and swallowed it after about 10 minutes. I had heard you felt some of the effects immediately and was anxious to see what would happen. 5 minutes passed... Nothing. 10 minutes... Nothing. 15 minutes... Began to notice short term memory loss as if I had smoked weed. For the next hour, the only difference I noticed was that my memory was definitely affected - I wasn't able to determine how long it had been since I had just done something so I continually was asking for the time. Nearly 3 hours after taking it, I was convinced that this shit was fake and was some other drug with minor side effects. Man was I wrong...

About 3 and a half hours after placing the tab on my tongue, I began to trip HARD and I mean out of NOWHERE. One second I was pissed about it being fake and the next I was standing in a giant coliseum with wind rushing past me and a red sunset (despite being in a concrete pavilion at 11:45 PM). I was elated that it was real and began telling everyone. I layed on the ground and looked at a cloud moving in front of some stars that began to have a grid-like pattern move through it and then break into pieces like ice. I looked at a house and was completely sure that I was the guy in the mask from Scream - scared the shit out of me but I kept looking back over there because I wanted to see him again. After 7 hours or so, I finally came down but could still feel some effects up to 12 hours later.

All in all, great experience.
