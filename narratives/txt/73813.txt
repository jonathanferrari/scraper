I've ingested self-prepared cactus on a handful of occasions using the method of boiling it down into a couple mouthfuls of horrifically vile liquid.  I just wanted to share a helpful technique using which has helped me get it down easier.

Something I've found to help a bit is to coat my mouth with Honey prior to taking a shot of the green goo.  The thick consistency of the honey lets it stick all over my mouth (I get the back of your throat too as much as I can) and it prevents the goo from making as much contact.  I've also found that using the honey as a follow up is helpful, rather than water or some other liquid, because where thin liquids won't really rinse the taste off my tongue, the honey is thick enough to push it all down while simultaneously giving me a better taste in your mouth.

Hope this helps.
