I've been high before, but this was the most beautiful experience i've ever had. We were sitting around the circle and after getting stoned decided to put on pink floyd as usual. Then one of my friends said, 'Give this cd a chance.' The name of the cd was 'El Cielo' by a band called Dredg. We began our musical journey, the music is so haunting it's nearly impossible to describe in words.

I completely spaced and felt that the music only improved my high nearly two fold. Suddenly, I felt as if i was traveling, it felt like I was moving at lightspeed al thought it was apparent i was sitting still. I was immobilized. Completely paralyzed. I felt the sonic waves shining on me almost like the sun. I was no longer experiencing the music I was feeling it or even experiencing it. Now i've probably listened to the album nearly 100 times all the way through, and sometimes when I'm sober, this album even gives me a flash back high. I will never forget the first time I experienced music asopposed to just feeling it.
