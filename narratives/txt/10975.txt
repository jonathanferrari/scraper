 O.K., Been tripping for five years on cid and shrooms, lots of shrooms.This particular experience, happened to be the strongest dose ever.Myself and seven other people, all close freinds, had gathered together for a trip session. A very special occasion since we never get to see each other.A week before, me and three of the others had got the acid and we sampled it. I took one and then another after I had peaked.The best trip that I had ever encountered.Smooth, clean the greatest visuals.Just the three of us on the fourth of july watching the fire works explode in to cosmic angels, chillin with my gal, and haveing revolations beyond my normal symbolic mindscape.Great I thought.The second trip, with all seven of us, had started out different.I thought , hey what the hell, I handled the last one like a pro, why not toss back three or four.No big deal.A few of the others had taken large doses as well.I can feel the first vibes run up and down my body about twenty minutes later.We all were sitting in the living room of the small two bedroom apt.I could barely understand what anyone was saying, I could here their voices but their lips did not move at all.We all experienced this same thing, as we discussed this later.

I remember I was afraid that they were against me for some reason and I was afraid to say anything for fear that it might be true.I must have been quiet for an hour into the trip before I got the nerve to pull one of my best friends to another room and make sure that I wasnt insane.I had been trapped in my own fear and insecurities for a long time.What felt like an eternity.I was relieved to find that I was not the only person that was experiencing this.I went outside on the porch to breath the fresh air and get a grip on myself.Soon as I got out there I snapped out of it.I Went back in to discover that my cousin was running around the house swithing the lights on and off saying, Im Jeremy Im going to bed.This would of been fine if he had of stopped.He was stuck in a loop.Thats all he could do, he said the same things over and over again, and could not sit down, as if he could not figure out what he should be doing.LSD unlocks you from the dreadful repititions of boring habitual tendencies,that seem to consume our lives.He wasnt ready.Finally he was convinced to take an enormous bong hit and that did the trick. He snapped right out of it.We all had a giant learning experience that night.First, know what your taking,how strong it is and there is no need for taking more than is necessary.Two, plan out your trips.LSD is not for shits and giggles.

It can be negative in a negative environment.LSD is a tool for evolution, and can be used effectively as such. Planning a session, taking the time to do it right is important. We were in a crowded room, we couldnt be loud , we were in an apt.The first time I tripped on this cid it was only the three of us and we were comfortable there. With seven people in a small room , not enough things to occupy us.Ive tripped hard as hell at parties where I almost lost it because of unfamiliar faces and uncomfortable surroundings.Bad tripps are not the effect of the drug, but the effect of the surroundings.
