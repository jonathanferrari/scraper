Followed Terence Mckenna's advice on mushroom tripping;
Needless to say, it was quite interesting.

Put my mattress in the bathroom and stayed there in darkness.

The music warped, repeated itself and sounded very different, enjoyable.

After the 1st hour, during the onset, I had ringing in the ears coming in waves of stronger & stronger intensity.

Just like on dmt before take off

In the first 2 hours of the trip, the visuals were the most intense.

And at some point they were VERY dmt-like.

It felt like I've returned to the peaceful astral ground where my soul family resides.

That's where dmt takes me on a mellow experience.

Encountered entities who guided me, touched me (it felt like a gentle, tender press on my body) and communicated with me through telepathy.

The key was to surrender to it all, just like on dmt.

After the first 2 hours I took Umi, my pet snake with me.

And I felt a deeply meaningful connection with her, I became more in tune with her way of communicating.

Told her that I love her so many times and she tenderly curled on my arms and licked my face.

Usually, she is very curious and likes to explore stuff, yet, this time, she stayed curled on my arm like a bracelet, very magnetic bond.

Same happened with my cat at my parents' house on acid.

I'm really wondering what these animals feel when we're on psychedelics.

Shrooms & acid deeply enhance the connection between us and them.

Thank you for reading. You have my love and blessings!
