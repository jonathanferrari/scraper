Shrooms and Weed

One day I decided to try some mushrooms. So I headed to my friends house. When I arrived there he whipped out an eighth of shrooms and a half ounce of bud. We split the mushrooms and rolled a fat doobie. I ate the mushrooms then we smoked a joint to take off.

About twenty minutes later I started feeling the effects of the shrooms. I was sitting in a chair it looked like a bunch of flys were flying all over one flew towards my face it slowed down and I could see right in its eyes. We decided to go outside because my friend said it's alot trippier outside. When we walked out the colors were very bright and vibrant. I started hearing things like birds and buzzing in my head. My friend and I were talking but I could'nt comprehend what he was saying it sounded fucked up.

After that we went back inside and threw half baked in the vcr. The movie started I didn't really understand it but all the noises sounded cool. I looke at an old movie case with a fairy on it it looked like it was dancing to the music in the movie. Aboutr 7 hours after I ate them I started going down.
