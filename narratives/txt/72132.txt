I have found the true meaning of god within this trip.

It was the summer of 02 leading on to another stage of my high school years, this journey took place particularly early. A friend  decided to watch over me and put in a video of awe 'Fantasia.' This would begin my trip and soon we both decided a change of scenery was needed.

We decided to go to a neighborhood friends house.  This is where my trip really began, I started to watch the cabinets melt into the floor, I saw 'dazed and confused' over and over on the TV screen, ghosts were on the wall and I could not tell whether I was hot or cold.  These were potent mushrooms indeed and I knew my best bet was to lie down somewhere and enjoy the day.  

After this intense experience I knew god was found within each and every one of us as a voice that lets us know right from wrong.  It is our own personal devils advocate.
