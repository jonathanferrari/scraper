Last Ketamine Experience

This was one of my last times using ketamine.  I was sitting at home pretty bummed out and I had some ketamine, so I figured I might as well do a line or so.  So I measured out somewhere near a gram and made a pretty fat line.  I snorted it using a dollar bill.  One thing I've noticed with ketamine is that the more I take the quicker it hits me.  It didn't take very long for the effects to wear in.  I was sitting at my computer talking to some friends and I became completely numb. I couldn't focus on any one thing and I had no idea what was going on.  I was in my own room and I had this feeling that I had no idea where I was and it scared me.  I felt like I had lost control of everything, even physically.  The room began to spin and I lay down on my bed completely strung out.  Another thing I started to notice about ketamine is that my tolerance for the substance built up pretty fast.  The little amount it would take a first-timer to trip for about an hour and a half only would last me like a half-hour or so.  So, because of this I had to increase the amount I was doing regularly.  Ever since I began to increase the amount I was taking it seems like my trips have been way more intense and too hard to handle and I just lost all sense of reality whatsoever on these trips.    Overall I think ketamine is a pretty good drug.  I think it is quite fun to do in small doses and not so often as much as everyday, which is pretty much what I was doing.  This drug when taken in large doses just strung me out and the smaller doses weren't doing anything for me at all. I decided for me that it would be much better to just stop doing it altogether.
