I took the 2 epills at like 2:15 and they kicked in real fast because I hadn't eaten anything but a bagel and a piece of fruit. I was with others who were rolling as well, but my high was definitely coming on harder and stronger and I couldn't deal with their fast talking. I turned some dvd on earlier that I thought may be sweet to watch rollin and tried to focus on it but it felt like my vision was darting back and forth and I needed to close my eyes and try to chill.

After regaining composure, sort of, I opened my eyes again held my knees close, blocked out the voices, and actually enjoyed the hilarity of what I was watching even though I was shaking and kind of freaking out as the e was coming on stronger. Then the voices of my fellow rollers starting to get to my high and I definitely felt like I had to vom, but I felt like I had control over it. I just went downstairs and vomited in the toilet down there (which is what happens basically at the beginning of whenever I roll) and felt better. When I came back upstairs I felt like they were on my level and we all chilled in the dark with the computer playing music and watching the screen. We'd drink water ritually and made sure to do everything together at the same time, and make sure we were all feeling good and were comfortable, but it really just felt like we were all freaking out and I wish it could've been more chill. When we came down from the e we took some sedatives to make it less painful, but the morale of the group then plummeted and the other people I was rollin with were miserable and it bummed me out big time. I just wanted to be alone. 

Once I got home I still felt ok, but after I took a nap and woke up I felt miserable. Absolutely  miserable. Nothing was good everything was bad and I felt so alone.

I eventually got to feeling better after I took more sedatives and smoke more weed but was still sore and the sadness still lingered.
