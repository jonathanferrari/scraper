I thought I'd post something about this because I have never heard of anyone doing this... I extracted some mescaline from a few feet of san pedro cactus and only yielded a small amount of oil. (I skipped the last step to turn it into a salt) So I had a pea sized ball of brownish black mescaline. Me and two others smoked it out of a bong on top of some burnt weed and we all seemed to get the same effect. The smoke tasted foreign but not unpleasant, and I felt very lightweight and wavy. It was a very happy and friendly feeling (but very shortlived) . I wish I had a bit more but the cactus I was using must have not been too potent because I only got about 100mg from approx 3 feet. Better luck next time.
