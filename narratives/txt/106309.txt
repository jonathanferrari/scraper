Dimethyltryptamine Trials

DMT IV V VI
Me and my friend D decided to make a 'Machine Pipe' after I told him how my failures in a lightbulb vaporizer and how harsh the smoke is. We broke a coke bottle, and rebuilt it via duct tape with a small mouthpiece at the top of the pipe (technically the bottom of the bottle), loaded it up with DMT, by putting it on steel wool and putting it in the neck, amazingly I went first, it worked, paint splatters on the floor became ritualistic giant patterns and dots, and my hamper had become a alien plant, soon enough it wore off after my friend tried messing with me by throwing a sock ball.

V
I did it a hour later with D, and I saw laid down and looked at the ceiling this time, except the ceiling was now a shit ton of patterns, wasn't a full breakthrough 

VI
This one wasn't with D, but after D left, I got the breakthrough I wanted but it was an unwanted vision. I saw every memory, every moment of my life, pass by, over and over, and over, the future became in the past too, I could do nothing but be helpless, my bed was water, and I felt like I vomited but I didnt, out of all these memories were bad ones truly, it lasted for what seemed like years, and it was like every day up until that day, and a few scenes of when I would be 40 in a house of my own.
