It was a brisk fall night around 8 o'clock and I was home alone at the time, Just me half an ounce of weed and my mushrooms. So I simply heated up sum pizza put my mushrooms on the pizza and ate it is now about 9:30, rite after I ate and decided to smoke a few bowls out of my bong.

Then my parents got back and the adventure began, now my parents are of the strictest of all and smoking or drugs of any kind was certainly not aloud, But seeing as I was on them anyways I figured who cares, so I moved up out of the basement in my room were I continued to smoke, door wide open, then the shrooms kicked in and hard, I slowly felt my self falling out of one world and passing into the next, I felt my self seeing things that cannot be written things of unimaginable meaning and beauty, and yet I felt still that I had not reached the level of "beauty and true reality" that I was looking for, so it was then that I began to smoke, again.

Then I remembered that I had some left over syrian rue seeds so I began to chew on them I had about 6 or 8 caps worth. After this point I reached the level that I was looking for and it was then that the climax began. It was now around 11:30 and I decided that I had to go on a journey to find the boundaries of reality, it was then that I left my house to go and wander the world so weed lighter and pipe in hand I began this quest, I had walked about Â¼ of a mile when a large chariot of angels approached and the chariot stopped and I climbed on, all ready riding the chariot was two beings one with hair of fire and the other was unseen just a dark outline, (this turned out being my friend in his big white hummer and his read head girlfriend). It was then that while riding the glorious chariot that I explored the boundaries of reality, using what seemed like the speed of light we traveled the world, but one of the beings, the one with hair made of fire fell of and fell into the world around us, It was then that I pulled out my tools and began to burn all of the trees in the basin (I started smoking again). Suddenly though I too fell of the glorious chariot into the world surrounding me it was then that I wandered through every place of unfamiliarity until I reached a familiar place, I had by this time walked about 4 miles and it was probably around 3 o clock in the morning and I then finally found my house, I walked in and climbed to the clouds where I blessed my burnt offerings and burned them (incense) and I again burned the trees in the basin, at this point I finally fell into a dream that I cannot even describe or explain.
