It was early June, my cousin and I had just been granted a view into nature.  We setup camp in our lovely mountain canyon and began eating. (with the assistance of Subway sandwiches....making sure I put them directly into the juicy parts of the sandwich, let sit for 5 mins( to get rid of the crunchyness))

Anywho, after a while of starring at our fire we realized there was something magical about it today, but we weren't quit unsure of what exactly, only that it was fun to look at. I remember standing up and I told my good cousin 'B' that 'I think I want to walk around.'

From there it was all somewhat of a blurr.  As I remember coming up higher, we wandered through our canyon/forestry and slowly we were becoming more and more connected with all the plants and natural surroundings, at one point I said  'B, I feel like we are man-animals.'  He naturally agreed with this, seeing as we were wondering about the forest, and we both had the idea that there was something great coming up beyond our sight of the forest path, and as I think back, I realize that the whole thing was an enjoyable experience.

At one point I looked up into the clouds and pointed out a cloud which closely resembled a skull to the both of us.

After joyously wondering around the canyon/forest for about 5 hours, we finally sat down to stare at our camp fire again, at this we were returning to reality.  I didn't have any visual effects with this breed of mushroom, but the night was purely magical to say the least.

I cannot emphasize just how close we both felt to nature that day, so close we realized that we were/are indeed a part of our Earth.

NOTE: Ive been reading over various trips online and I have seen a few fools who have been tripping and driving at the same time.  First of all, people who do this aren't doing a very good job at being safe, second, people who drive tripping don't give us safe/wise trippers a chance in the general stereotyping eye of the general public.
