DMT World

I sit down, hold lighter half an inch from the metal pipe containing the yellow crystals, inhale slowly and deeply, hold the vapor in as long as I can, repeat. Set pipe and lighter down, sit back, close eyes and hold on tight. 

I know its starting when I taste static electricity in my mouth and feel it spreading to my jaw and then rapidly throughout my body. Behind my eyelids a world unfolds. I am sailing quite quickly over a dark three-dimensional plane, and I stop at a large wall covered with beautiful colors and patterns. Somehow I force myself through this wall and I end up in what seems like a rather large room. The walls, floor, ceiling and objects in the room all have the same patterns of purple, red and blue against black. I am moving about the room quite slowly, admiring the beauty and intricacy of these patterns. Then I look up and see a face staring back at me, about 4 inches from my nose. The face is dark and has large eyes, reminding me of a fly's head. I stare for a couple seconds, a little startled, before the being begins to show me something. It does not use language, but instead shows me a model of the human body. The body's skin was transparent, showing the vast networks of nerves and blood vessels. As the model rotates counter-clockwise I look at the brain, through the many networks of nerves I notice that a particular part of the brain is highlighted in a pale yellow, reminding me of the color of the crystals I had just inhaled. This highlighted section is nearly at the center of the brain, which I assume to be the pineal gland. The highlighted gland also has many nerves and blood vessels highlighted around it, branching out to other parts of the brain and body. I look away and feel myself returning to my body, the image of the body and the room turns to wispy smoke coming out of a pipe blowing in a breeze.
