At 10:50 took 1 blotter of acid. An hour later noticed patterns appearing on carpet. Happier and light is different. Pupils are contracting and dilating a lot. Decide to take another blotter. 5 minutes later decide to take two other blotters. Unlike some people I never regretted this rather impulsive decision. The hallucinations on the carpet intensify and the euphoria increases.

Light continues to change, having neon appearance. Slightly nausoeus/have mild indigestion symptons. Pupils very big even under bright light. Tracers appear and grow stronger. Haven't lost these tracers to this day, when I've been clean for days. Not complaining though, adds an iteresting effect to life.

Music sounds superb. It's like something muffling the muic when you're sober has been peeled away. Music is cleaer sounding, more fluid. Listen to Royksopp, Air, Orbital and FSOL, my favourite music for tripping. Light on people's faces is different. Strong closed eye visuals -  a carnival of light. Mad creative thoughts. My emotional strings were never plucked like with shrooms once. I am happy throughout and never feel depressed.

Loud noises are irratating. Textures are different. Strange colours appear on peoples faces. The floor swirls like liquid, just like on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I'm content to relax for hours. Woodgrains look amazing - they flow like waterfalls. Looking at people skin, my eyesight is enhanced to the degree that I can clearly see every individual hair follicle on people's skin.

Symptons gradually fade. Patterns on walls and carpets remain for a log tome, the tracers even longer (still have them now as I write this report). I really enjoyed my trip on acid and wouldn't hesitate to do it again.
