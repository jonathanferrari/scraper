Some time ago I embarked with fellow students from my University to Amsterdam to sample the local culture. I ended up speaking to another student from Manchester, who introduced me to Super-Skunk at one of the venues in the city. After taking our seats and acquiring a certain amount of the substance, rolled nicely into a 'doobie', I proceeded to smoke the joint. 

After a few 'tokes', I began to feel very odd indeed and very quickly it appeared as if time was going backwards. After that I stumbled back to the hostel, where I was staying, and began to panic. The chemical wore-off after a couple of hours and, thankfully, there was someone there who helped to allay my fears. All-in-all, an awful experience that in retrospect I was very unprepared for. That said, I am still inspired by Aldous Huxley's 'The Doors of Perception' and look forward to experimenting further in the future. The more we understand the effects of all dopes, the better they can be applied in future.
