I guess I should start with a quick psychoactive background.  I never did any drugs whatsoever until after my 21st when I got drunk the first time.  Later I decided to try weed with my best friend who had been smoking for quite a while.  Apparently with most people it's not this way, but that first time (it was decent bud at best but far from dank) I was totally ripped after about 3 puffs.  Obviously, I fell in love with it and after a 2 month dry spell began smoking twice or once a week.  We've got a regular little circle with my roommates and my best friend.

So a month or two after the circle was established my friend starts growing his own, and come final harvest time he has about half a pound of weed so he started selling the excess to friends at his job (a restaurant, so obviously he had plenty of contacts).

My dad has always been a better friend than father figure.  He's quite the character, and always a blast to hang out with.  We had his version of the drug talk when I was a younger guy and he told he that he had tried just about everything: meth, coke, heroin (once), shrooms, acid, and of course weed.  He then told me that all that was in the past and there's not all that much to it.  Later, when I got older and long after he and my mom had split up, he admitted that he still smoked weed occasionally, although that didn't really make me want to try it (I was very down on all drugs until that magical day I first got drunk).

So a few months ago I told him that I smoke weed.  At first he was a little flabbergasted, but then he just tried to fill his parental shoes as best he could by reminding me that it is illegal and telling me to be careful.  I of course told him I would and we left it at that.

The next time he came up for a visit, he asked me if I wanted to get high with him.  This time it was my turn to be speechless, but after a minute I just shook my head with a small laugh and said, 'I'll see if I can score.'
