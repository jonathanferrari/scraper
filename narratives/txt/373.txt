So I am going to a rave and I have a big mac on me a type of MDMA or e. Well after waiting 3 hours in the line I get in. Once in I have no idea were my friends are and I cannot find anyone. So I think I will get happy by dosing so I do but I do a half just to be safe. Well I wasn't aware of the time it would take to kick in so I did the other half I thought nothing of and at the time I was alone and felt hungry I was not high yet so I said let's eat hot dog. After the dog it kicked and when it did I stood up I felt very light headed so went to go sit by a wall by myself. I had my watch on and it was it was 12:30 so I thought would sit for 5 minutes well I passed out  for 3 hours. 

By this time I was dehydrated and sketchin out and this was not fun. I was alone, scared and cold so I found my friends them being high to thinking that they were smart said chug water and don't stop. After that I felt more sick at the time I was walking around I was watching a big tv screen and below was a guy dancing then he fell off the stage and hit the ground and then they showed him on the screen. So I left. I went outside it was cold then thats when the hot dog came up for a visit. I got a ride home then once at home I could not sleep. When I finally left my room I felt that everyone was out to get me. Then for the next 4 days at school I still felt high and I felt there was still something wrong and now everytime I dose I only get a good peak then its over.
