The only reason I take E is for spiritual expansion of my own consciousness. It has allowed me to be my true self more completely. I am less inhibited, yet it doesn't make me do anything I would not want to do, it just helps me get in touch with the inner wellspring of courage that I so often do not realize is there.

Ecstasy has also ignited major spiritual growth in my life. I have experienced kundalini energy rise up my spine while dancing at raves, although the biggest lesson I learned from E is that I should take more risks, because 9 times out of 10, I will be successful. Magical things happen for months after a successful trip.
