That Saturday morning I woke up and felt like smoking some ganj. I had never waked and baked before so I wasn't sure how much higher I would get. Now before I say anything else I want to tell you I had smoked weed about 300 times before this give or take. However, I somehow no matter how often I smoke can get little or no tolerance built up. I'm not complaining I actually like to save money. 

Anyway that morning I loaded up my homemade bong and toked away. What happened about 10 minutes later changed my purpose for getting high. Before this I just cared about getting as destroyed as possible. Well anyway after I finished smoking I layed down in my bed and put on my headphones and turned on a song that sounded trippy called strobe by deadmau5. My shoulders, which had been aching from carrying my heavy backpack began to feel a overwhelmingly euphoric rush. I just thought to myself, this is medicine for soul and body. I sat up in my bed looking out my window with the sunlight shining in on me and I felt just pure astonishment of the universe. I closed my eyes and I just kept thinking that this is God's herb and that it was placed here for a reason.Â 

I now look at getting high as a spiritual journey and hope to be enlightened, but I am not sure what I am looking for. Hopefully, some day I will be able to experiment with more powerful psychadelics.
