It was my first time on ecstasy and I did not exactly know what to expect. 

We scored from a man who didnt know well and I was speculating that the pills could have been cut with something, but I took the pill anyway. I was at a huge electronic concert with a whole lot of friends who were rolling on E as well, and most had taken it before. 

We made our way down to the dancefloor and started dancing to the beats. At this point it had been 45 minutes and I couldnt feel a thing. All of a sudden when the opening act ended, it hit me. It was like a beautiful rush of warmth had taken over my body, and I felt as if I was floating. The next 3 hours were a dream, a great dream. Everyone around me seemed so friendly and the music was running through my veins. 

An experience that I cant compare to other drugs such as marijuana or psilocybin mushrooms. When the concert was over, I was still rolling and craved hydration. I then consumed the best 4 bottles of water in my life. It was an experience that I hope to repeat in the near future. Very much worth the next couple days of dull life.
