I was having a huge sleepover at my house, for my birthday and about 20 people were there. A friend told me that he called his dealer and that he was going to come by at 2am to drop off some Ecstasy pills for us. My friend was gonna pay for me because it was my birthday. Eventually the dealer came, and dropped off about 11 blue pills, called 'blue ox's.' 

I took the pill at around 2:10 am. It was my first time ever rolling, so I was very nervous, so my friends told me to just sit, relax, and let it happen. It took about 25 minutes to feel it, at first I was thinking 'oh this is it?' then I stood up and suddenly I thought there was no gravity, and I could not stop smiling. Suddenly all my friends started crowding around me in a circle, I felt confused by all the people, and I could not walk, so my friend had to carry me. We went outside and I sat down, and I couldnt stop tapping my leg, and I was trying to describe the feeling, but all that I could say was 'I feel like, its me and the world is that.' I started touching everything and everything felt AMAZING. I couldnt stop giving people hugs, and I wanted to have deep emotional conversations with everyone. I was so happy. I told everyone one special thing I liked about them. Then I sat down and my friend gave me a light show with his hands, and my eyes started rolling behind my head, then I got a blanked and started twisting and smiling and making noises, then cuddled with my friend and fell asleep.

It was the most amazing expierience I have ever felt.
