I've been smoking chronic since I was 16. I've been experimenting with stronger drugs since the first time I tried mushrooms. X to me is like a "wonder drug."  The reason I say that is every time I'm down or the stress that life brings can sometimes be overwhelming, and X has always guided me out of life's troubles. I first time I tried x, I took two pills and had a blast! The second time I tried x, was about two weeks ago.

I've been having so much stress from work and my girlfriend from 5 years recently broke up with me so I took two x pills to elevate my mood. The x I took this time was way more potent than the last beans I got last time. These purple rhinos came up quick; I immediately felt it within 30 minutes. Covering myself in a warm blanket with some techno in my living room, I started to question my life, religion, and my ex girlfriend. No more worries, no more stress just pure happiness.  About an hour later into the trip, my living room became a living rainbow. All the color were so vivid, and the longer in stayed wrapped in my blanket the harder I would trip.  

I've never felt so free, and I can honestly say. I forgot about my relationship and was stressing me and it never came back. Not to mention all the crazy hallucinations while peaking. My peak lasted about 1:30, the plateau 5:00 and I crashed for the rest of the next day.
