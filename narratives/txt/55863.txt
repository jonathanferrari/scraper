I've been smoking for about 6 months now, and I've never had an experience this bizarre, especially now that my reactions to marijuana have calmed down and come under control considerably.

I'll admit, I was under some stress at the time, but I had smoked from the same batch the previous day - the same amount in the same setting - and had experienced full-blown euphoria. The combination of the weed's strength and my mental state must have been enough.

It started with the mirror in my bedroom. I had just finished smoking and listening to some music when I got up, and my face's image in the mirror caught my eye. I've been warned to avoid mirrors, but only regarding mushrooms. I had looked in that mirror the day before, and I saw myself in a movie, the glass of the mirror being the screen, and my movements somehow glorified and dramatized. At first, this was what I had expected, but slowly my face began to contort slightly to a point where my eyes and other facial features seemed out of place, lopsided, or twisted. I tried another mirror, and it was worse. It reminded me very much of Picasso's style of representing faces.

I thought maybe it was just me, and my face. But then I watched TV, and saw other faces on the computer, and experienced the same twisted, ugly view - on everyone. It seemed my entire concept of the human face had changed, and now the natural image looked alien to me. By the end of the night, harmless TV shows were scaring me to the point that I had to go to sleep simply so I wouldn't have to deal with the rest of the effects.

I regularly experience mild (or moderate, depending on dosage) open and closed eye visuals from good weed, but never have I witnessed such unique and frightening hallucinations from just pot, let alone such a small amount.
