I started speeding hardcore about 1hr after taking .25g and snorting .1g. Then it all went downhill. I started getting a headache. My stomach was in knots. My chest was heavy and I couldnt take a deep enough breath I got incredibly cold and just couldnt get warm. I started shaking. I couldnt balance very well when trying to sit down on my bed. And I had goosebumps for like 2 hrs. Now, 8 hrs later (yes I'm coming down as I type) I still have a dull headache. My chest feels hollow. I'm still freezing. Mostly just my hands and feet now though. It is terrible. No depression yet. Unfortunately no energy either. Just the feeling of coming off speed.
