It all started around 4:30 in the afternoon. After a day of walking all around my small hometown (which is about 3 miles), I was pretty tired. But, I made the trek to my best friend's house on the other side of [town] with two of my other friends. The night before, two out of the four friends had taken one hit of acid and had amazing experiences. I decided that I would try acid for the first time, ever.

So, I took one hit around 5 and we decided to walk through the forest on the other side of town. The effects of the acid had already started to kick in a little bit, seeing as how I was becoming slightly giggly and things seemed to be bouncy and floaty like a cloud. We sat in the middle of the path in the forest and everything seemed so surreal. The world seemed to be moving slowly up and down like we were floating on a cloud. I was laughing, almost hysterically at this point and I'm not even sure why. No one really said anything funny, everything just seemed hilarious.

Then we started walking down the path some more. And then down a huge hill. This is when the acid started taking effect almost completely. As soon as we got to the bottom of the hill, we were in a huge field with a giant old chimney in the middle (from a house that was there long ago, but isn't there anymore). I just dropped to my knees laughing hysterically and shaking everywhere. I was laughing so incredibly hard that tears were flowing from my eyes. My friends just kept laughing and saying, 'Ohh, she's tripping balls!' And I thought that it was the most hilarious thing on the planet. 

The next hour we sat in this field, listening to Kings of Leon and Neutral Milk Hotel while staring at the sky and being almost completely confused. I kept trying to stand, but it felt like I didn't have any legs. I was still laughing and smiling nonstop. It was honestly the most fun I and joy I have felt in quite a long time. It brought me back to when I was younger with my friends, laughing all of the time in junior high and just being obnoxious adolescents. 

We decided then to walk up to a giant monument about a mile away that overlooks most of our city. The walk seemed to take forever and it was tiring. Mostly because I was still laughing and crying all at the same time, which was taking the breath right out of me. As soon as we reached the monument and sat down on it, I started tripping really, really hard. All of the trees looked as though they were either breathing or nodding their heads and it was insane. The whole monument, which is made out of granite, honestly looked like cookies and cream ice cream and it was tripping me out, really, really bad. We were all sitting there, me and only one of my other friends tripping and just laughing. My other friend that was tripping with me looked as though he was part of the statue. I called my friend on the phone, who had already left for college and made barely any sense while trying to talk to her. Everything was just amazing and I felt so incredibly happy, it was insane. I drew a little in my friend's notebook and it ended up being pretty hilarious. At one point, people showed up at the monument- an older couple. I just remember that they were sitting about ten feet from us and everything they said sounded like gibberish. It sounded as if I were a baby and I couldn't make out words yet.

The only bad part about sitting up on the monument was when my mom and one of my good friends texted me. It was almost impossible for me to send a text message back. I was seeing trails in almost everything by this point and every time I tried to move my thumbs to type the message, I would just start laughing when I saw how intense the colors and phone screen looked. Everything was so bright in the sky too, it was lovely. 

After all of that, we walked back. By this time it was getting dark and we were walking down a heavily forested path. I started getting really, really scared and I felt like I was about to have a bad trip. Since it was almost pitch black, I could barely see anything behind or in front of me and I kept seeing people that weren't really there. I clung to one of my sober friends and starting crying a little. It seemed when we were on the monument and the sun was out that everything was good and happy, but as soon as we walked further down the path, everything started getting bad and uncomfortable. I just remember that I kept looking back up the hill from where we cameÂ– from where the monument was and I started feeling as though I was slipping further and further into darkness. I started crying a little harder and my friend just kept telling me that it was ok and that he was there and that nothing bad was going to happen. So, we kept walking. Finally when we made it back into the city, we became a little more quiet and calm. 

We walked back to my friend's house and chilled out in his basement. We were all laughing hysterically and tripping out again pretty hard. Everything seemed so flashy and bright and wonderful.  We went out into the backyard and smoked a bowl. This intensified everything even more. By this point, it was almost 10, so we had been tripping for about five hours.

At some point, I went to the bathroom in his house. I know that they tell you never to look in a mirror when you're on acid because you can become lost in it. And of course, I looked. Everything in the mirror was twisty and strange and it looked as though the lights on the top of the mirror were bending and twisting. It was so surreal. Before I got too scared, I forced myself to look away and walked out of the bathroom.

We went into the basement and turned off all of the lights and listened to some music. The music was amazing and at some points, I kept thinking that we weren't really in the basement listening to music, but outside. It was so surreal. 

After that, I went home and tried to chill out by myself before I fell asleep. I noticed some movement in some objects in my room (Like my bed looked like it was breathing). I fell asleep fairly quickly, though. 

The next morning I was pretty exhausted and my legs were killing me. But in the end, it was well worth it. 

It was probably one of the best experiences with a drug that I have ever had in my life. But, I would always make sure that there is a trip-sitter there, AKA someone who will watch you or stay with you who is sober while you trip. Mainly because if you start having a bad trip or you get scared, they're there to calm you down and let you know that everything is going to be ok. 

All in all, my experience was amazing.
