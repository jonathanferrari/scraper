Setting: my apartment

I lit up the freebase pipe, until the white smoke was billowing out of the top.. I inhaled deeply, the fumes continued to grow in the glass, it's very harsh.. I hold and exhale, and repeat 3 more times.. My heart begins beating rapidly, my head becomes tingly. Heroin by The Velvet Underground is playing, but begins to fade as my vision begins to blur rapidly and all sound deteriorates, except for what I can only describe as the vibrations of the universe, massive humming like a jet engine yet serene and calming.. I feel as if the fabric of my reality is tearing apart in front of me, a huge gaping hole of color and intense light is now the only thing In my field of vision.. It is hurtling toward me, rushing, at a very intense speed. The intensity drops, and I see nothing but a beautiful array of color that cannot be described.. Balls of light circle me and seemingly take me by the hands and pull me with them as if to show me something.. What I see next is intense.. There is a massive glowing light that makes me shiver due to the intensity of the energy it is putting out, it is love.. Love in the purest form, I feel the happiest I have ever felt and the most at peace I have ever been.. This slowly fades to darkness with vibrations of patterns of colors shimmering in the distance.. A heavy wave or rush of heat fills my body, this goes away and I slowly regain sense of reality. This was truly one of the most astonishing trips I've ever had. I'm back now and everything around me just isn't real. I can't describe it. It's as if I have been born for the first time. Everything seems fabricated.. What's real? What is this that I'm experiencing? This trip has left me feeling a sense of content with my surroundings. I have no fear of anything anymore. Life might as well be a dream.
