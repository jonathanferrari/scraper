I've orally ingested mushrooms several times and consider myself pretty acquainted with the affects. 
    
I packed a glass pipe with 2 Grams of medium-high grade dried, coarsely ground psilocybin caps and proceeded to smoke it.  The smoke was very harsh to the throat and lungs, but the taste was bearable.  I smoked the entire bowl and waited it out. 

After a few minutes I became slightly more relaxed and my vision became a little blurred.  After 10 minutes of just sitting around (feeling like I just smoked some pot), I got up and engaged myself in repairing my truck.  After I stopped thinking about the 2 grams I smoked my mind was completely clear again (25 minutes) and I was left only with motivation.
     
This experience has furthered my belief that the human mind is a powerful thing. I've seen and experienced this phenomenon occur with other substances as well (Hydrangea leaves, garden variety salvia, etc). If I think I'm gonna get high from smoking mushrooms, my mind doesn't want to disappoint, so my perception is altered.  As I engage myself in a different train of thought my senses are returned to normal.  
     
This may sound far fetched, but I'd say smoking mushrooms is more of a placebo effect than a chemical high, especially when smoked with other substances (cannabis, tobacco), where I may be able to intensify the affects of one drug by thinking I'm being influenced by the other.  
   
I am not a doctor, so forgive me if I'm blatantly wrong here.  I'm just stating the conclusions I've come to through my own experimentation.
