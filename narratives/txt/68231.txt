Before trying mushrooms I had read an extensive amount of information on psychedelics.  I had not had good experiences with the small dosages of LSD, pot, or XTC;  all gave me terrible feelings of dread and paranoia, or what most would conclusively refer to as 'bad trips.'  Longing to reach this fabled state of 'euphoria' which my friends often talked about, and interact more intimately with my imagination, I decided to finally try mushrooms.  

It was right after finals at my university. I had told my 'experienced' friends to 'sit' me while I tried mushrooms for the first time.  At around 8 PM I ate 1.5 grams of mushrooms mixed with a bit of chocolate syrup.  Surprisingly, it tasted pretty good and the mushrooms tasted like any other fungi I'd apply to my pizza.  

At around 8:30 PM nothing had happened yet and I was beginning to have my doubts. I decided to eat 1 more gram.  At this point I began to get rather impatient with my trip ever kicking in.  I walked outside to my friend's porch and sat on one of his wooden chairs.  After sitting for a few minutes I began to feel incredibly entranced with a street lamp standing far in the distance.  I felt as if I could not look away.  I finally turned my head to a car parked nearby and found that several waves and colors were beginning to appear before me.  I rubbed my eyes several times and the waves and trails simply reappeared.  I turned my eyes to my foot which I had decided to prop up upon the porch-table and everything before my eyes began to shift into what looked very much like the texture of an oil painting.  

At about 9:45 PM I decided to go back inside.  The walls of my friend's house, which normally would be a plain off-white, now had colorful patterns of green and pink traveling throughout them.  I went to use the restroom, and afterwards, while washing my hands, I began to stare at the water going down the drain.  The waves of water began to resemble something familiar.  A strong feeling a deja vu overcame me and I found I could not look away.  I turned off the sink and stared at the remaining droplets of water.  They began to shift and dance before me, as if they were little people putting on a circus show for me.  

  I am not sure how long I stood looking at the sink and from then on I lost complete track of time.  I went to sit on the couch in the next room and watch tv.  Two of my friends had decided to go to the store to get some food to cook for dinner.  My remaining sitter asked me how I was feeling.  For some reason when he asked me this, I suddenly thought of my parents and felt slightly homesick.  I began to ask him if my parents were coming to visit me soon.  He seemed confused, so I asked him again.  I began to forget where I was and what city we lived in.  I felt an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia.  My vision blurred more and more and the objects which sat cluttered on my friends table looked as if they had begun to dance.  I asked him if my parents were in the next room and he began to grow greatly amused.  

  My two friends returned from the grocery store and began to cook some soup in the kitchen.  Being left alone in front of the tv, I felt strangely compelled to lie down on the floor.  I laid on top of my stomach, stretched out my hands and closed my eyes.  When I reopened them (or perhaps I didn't?) I saw stars, space, and comets, and waves of energy everywhere.  I saw the image of a vast universe and I was a worm swimming through it, traveling through different dimensions.  I saw a large three dimensional cube before my eyes.  I entered it and suddenly saw hats and coats everywhere.  There were blinking monitors and strange voices kept calling my name.  I looked over my shoulder to find myself in a new room.  The walls were green and large hooks poked out of the ceiling and the walls.  I decided hang my self up on one, by my shirt.    As I 'hung' there a strong feeling of relaxation hit me and suddenly all of my life's worries were gone.  

Suddenly I fell from the wall into a large black hole.  I felt as if my body was being sucked through a funnel and finally I was spit out into another room with a table.  I began to cough and gag.  My legs felt numb and I could not walk or speak.  I crawled hastily over to the table and saw a beautiful woman (or at least something resembling a woman) look at me.  I felt as if I knew her.  'My future wife.' I thought. She melted and faded away before my eyes, and I crawled beneath the table.   For some reason I began to feel as if this were the true reality and I had complete control, complete freedom to travel to any dimension or world I wanted.  No longer did I have to be tied to the rules or laws that governed us in human society.  I was a god within my own world, my own imagination.

  Shortly, after making this conclusion, all of my images disappeared.  I opened my eyes (perhaps they were always open?) to discover myself back on the floor.  My friend's collection of cd's were scattered before me, obviously having been shuffled out of order by my hands which had been extended toward them.  My two friends were now eating simply observing my incredibly strange behavior, describing that I had simply been 'wriggling on the floor and mumbling.'  I sat back up on the couch and looked at them for a long time. They felt somewhat uncomfortable.   I suddenly forgot who they were and no longer recognized them.  They no longer looked human, but more like just a strange collection of shapes and objects.  'Who are they?  Did they take away all the dreams I was just having?'  I repeatedly asked them who they were, but when they told me their names I simply shook my head in disbelief and asked them again.  I looked around the house.  I felt trapped.  I had to escape.  I began to throw at them pieces of paper, cds, or whatever I could get a hold of from nearby (thankfully nothing fragile or dangerous!).  

Finally, at the culmination of my anger, I grabbed a glass of water my friends had poured for me in the beginning of the night and drenched myself with it.  The water felt like three dimensional blocks running down my body.  I sat back on the couch, relaxed, and closed my eyes, finally at peace.  

In the morning I woke up and all was well again.  My perception of reality felt the same - no hallucinations or confusion, but the same 'euphoria' I had felt during of peak of my trip seemed to have returned and I felt as if I had achieved, at least temporarily, a bit of inner peace and understanding with myself.  On the other hand, I think the irrational behavior I demonstrated freaked out my friends a bit.  

In conclusion, I think shrooms were a both fun and slightly scary experience.  To say the least, it was incredibly interesting...and I would really like to try them again some time soon.
