6:00 pm - at about 15g of dried san pedro tissue, taste was not as bad as people say.  Just ate the tissue, chewed it with grapefruit juice

7:00 pm - slight dizziness, body high, unusual body sensations.

7:30 pm - Consumed another 15g of tissue.    Feeling a little bit spacey.

8:30 pm - Went for a walk to the convenient store, slight visuals such as large blobs of colors.  A small feeling of disattatchment from reality.  Headlights, streetlights looked sort of interesting.   Also any patterns seemed intruiging but no real strong visuals.

9:30 on- Nothing too interesting, definately felt like zoning, staring etc.  Slight psychedlic feel (i.e. feeling 'weird' but not being able to pinpoint it),

Conclusion:  I believe that me and my friend (we both consumed 30g)  did not eat enough of the cactus to fully feel it.  Although there was definately a presence, it was not significant enough.  We could still talk normally, do logical things and think clearly.  We definately felt nauseous throuqh the majority of the experience, but did not vomit, and it was bearable.
