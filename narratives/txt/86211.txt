First MDMA experience data

First time using MDMA. Used about 350mg in a 6 hour timespan.

Effects were terrific euphoria at first, and a relaxed comedown after that.

After effects:

Day after: still somewhat trippy, compassionate with others, unable to focus on complex subjects, restless, no appetite.

Day 2: somewhat restless, tired, limited appetite.

Day 3: appetite returned, somewhat 'down' feeling, dizziness and 'brain zaps', difficulty to concentrate on subjects requiring focus of mind.

Day 4: dizziness and brain zaps, other effects remained although lighter than before.

Day 5: no more noticeable effects.
