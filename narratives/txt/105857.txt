Always had an unhealthy interest in drugs as a child. Sid Vicious a hero. 

At 12 year old had my first drug experience in 1981 this were very uncommon. Some older lads at a youth club had been picking Magic Mushrooms and after a bad trip Tragic mushrooms. I were showing off naively eating a larger dose than normal handfuls. After returning home were laid on sofa in living room with my mum and will always remember on TV was the film about The first accepted gay Icon. Quentin Crisp. The film called The naked civil servant. The sofa suddenly felt as though swinging similarly to the Pirate Ship theme park ride. New mind were altering. The hallucinations began as flowers on wallpaper were flying up the wall. 

Going to bed at 12 tripping off a gigantic dosage. Lay terrified in bed. Not knowing about drugs. I laid outside on the landing with the light on. Finally arose my mum and made up a ridiculous story some lads at school had put some mushrooms on my salad and found out they were Pscilobin. Natural LSD type trip. LSD being designed in a lab by an expert. Mushrooms ben nature's hallucinogenic. 

Anyway sniffed glue. Smoked weed. Speed. Then the 89 wonderful ecstasy craze. Had to fight authorities to get the music played. Now it's just absorbed into the system. Had better and older experience with LSD and the pre skunk days of redseal used to resemble sheep droppings. Have tried Mkat, China White, Go caine and Dust till dawn.
