This was the first time I had ever done it. My boyfriend at the time came over and gave me one. Told me to chew it up. So I did. It was jus us two at my house. Which was extremely boring BTW not much to do. So we sat there...watching tv. 

About an hour goes by and I start feeling extremely anxious. I kept grinding my teeth and I had a blanket in my hand that I had to keep wringing. My bf kept wanting to touch me and tried to get me to have sex but I didn't want him at all. And his touches repulsed me, didn't feel good at all. I didn't wanna get up and move I felt weird and uncomfortable when I did. So the entire time we just sat there. Watching tv. He obviously got pissed off because I didn't want to have sex so he went to bed and just left me downstairs alone. Another hour went by and I finally got up to go to bed too. The blanket I had been messing with was completly soaked from my sweaty ass hands lol. 

So I went and laid down and felt like I was dying. I laid there with my eyes wide open til the sun came up. I eventually passed out but that was the worst experience ever!!! Don't do x unless you're in the right environment of else it will SUCK!
