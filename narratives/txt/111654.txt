Thorax focal point

I finally got my hands on some acid after trying to find it for about a year. I bought 5 250ug tabs (about 13Â€ each).

I have long been scared of LSD. Having had some traumatic experiences in my life (lost my father) I worried these things could affect me in a bad way. I'm also that kind of person that overthinks everything and feels a lot of paranoia. I was sure I'd have a bad trip.

I took my first dose on the 13th of february at my apartment, approx 80ug (1/3 of a tab) and it didn't do anything as I attempted to redose an hour in to make it kick in. Smoked some weed to help it get going but nothing. I was a bit discouraged. I talked with my dealer and he said I might just be very resistant. I had rolled on MDMA just a few days prior however so we judged that might be why. I was still nervous as could be about taking this low dose. 

18th of february, I woke up at 06:00. It was a nice morning, dark and quiet but yet comforting. I contemplated taking the LSD in the early morning for a bit before deciding to take half a tab at 06:30, and then I took another quarter by 07:00. 

Within the first 20 minutes I felt a sudden change. It was subtile yet distinct. I was wondering if this was placebo or not. The next hour or so was quite uneventful. I smoked some weed on my balcony and went back in by the computer; youtube. Watching old BF3 sketches was very fun. Actually at this point everything started to become very funny.

I went on giggling for minutes on end. Every joke in the video struck me. As I was trying to gather myself from the latest laughing attack the screen suddenly vibrated. All the lines became squiggly just like I'd expect. It looked very real. The more I looked at it the more it begun to wave around. I stood up and walked around my apartment for a bit - everything was getting very swirly and I couldn't look at anything for too long or else it swirled beyond recognition. But it was fine, I was happy about it, intrigued to see how everything around me started to morph.

I remember feeling cold over my skin and it felt so intense and interesting. I pinpointed in my mind the exact feeling of it against my skin and felt it shower over me. Every sensory input was just magic. I also felt like I was the same as the wood my bed was made out of, or any other material.

I put on some music on my wireless headset and blasted away. It was a generic summer music mix on youtube with some half naked girl on the thumbnail. I watched as she danced for me on the screen knowing full well I was watching a still picture. I walked around my place some more and at this point it felt like the world was updating once ever second or so, like watching a series of pictures in succession, but yet with a very smooth transition between the images. The music wasn't doing too much yet though.

Now, at this point everything was moving and frankly I couldn't even tell if it was supposed to or not. I had frequent laughing attacks and a moderate euphoric state while I explored my apartment looking at things, wondering about my own interesting ideas.

Then it happened, I closed my eyes and in a split second orbs of light were swirling around my body, falling towards my center. As the focal point of energy became my chest the most euphoric feeling I've ever experienced washed over me. It was a lucid light euphoria, burning like a bright sun in my chest. I let a few tears of joy run down my cheeks. Everything was in unity. Everything could be channeled through me.

The music was causing my senses to change, music had color and it would create vivid visual distortions. My eyelids felt like flintlock hammers, closing in an explosion of colors sparking patterns of bright neon '8-bit' bricks that washed over the peripheral of my eyes in all the colors of the rainbow.

Again I entered the euphoric state I was in before, the anticipation had me giggle like a small girl as the universe aligned itself to channel its energy through me. I closed my eyes, orbs, collision, light, everything. My body felt elevated as I floated through the room, at my fingertips I could choose to enter a more euphoric state at will. I felt in total control. Tears of joy fell on my face. I could see something beautiful.

At around 12 I was coming down a bit. The euphoria had settled a bit and I decided to try and do something. My computer screen was swirling so much I couldn't operate it. And it felt extremely weird using something with my hands. Like they were cold and dead. 

As I sat by the computer trying to figure something to do I watched the girl on the summer playlist video thumbnail. Suddenly everything went dark, the pleasant picture of a young woman turned into a witch and a dark fog shrouded my periphery. I was a bit startled by this and tried to reach for the mouse to change the music. My hand looked sick, morphing into a green/purple disgusting extremity. I realised what was going on, stood up and walked into another room. It helped immediately (thanks internet!). 

The come down was annoying. The euphoria only lasted for the first few hours and then I was stuck in a very vividly morphing world while being relatively normal. It wasn't all bad, but at some point I would have wanted to watch a movie or something but I really couldn't see a thing. 

Comparing it to MDMA, it was much more intense. The euphoria is on another level. It felt more unstable, lasted considerably shorter and needed a lot more work to get there though while MDMA is just a sure ticket to happiness. It felt like an effort going through the LSD trip, like I had to remain vigilant and on guard. Absolutely worth it though.
