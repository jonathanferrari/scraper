Ok so I am really into doing hallucinogens. Mostly Acid. I usually always have good trips on acid so I thought, (since I've done almost every other drug), why not try mushrooms... Me and two other friends only found 1/8 to buy so I wasn't thinking we would get too fucked up. My friends ate them first and as I was eating them right after them, one of my friends went to lie down and my other friend started talking jibberish on the couch. It kind of freaked me out. Why would they have hit them so fast and hard and only off of 1 cap and 1 stem each? So I sat down and five minutes later a very strange vibrating pulse was pushing down on my chest and I went into my bedroom to lay on the floor. I heard this weird noise that I can't describe and I instantly thought I was going to die. I started to panick and I allready wanted my trip to end. I stood up when I got a hold of myself and there were a bunch of people in my living room. People were drunk, and it was not a good combo. My fry lasted for a looooong time, like 12 hours. I ended up convincing myself I needed to go to the mental institution and I completely understood crazy people. I locked myslef in my room and thought aliens were taking over my apartment. This was the worst time I've ever had on any drug at all! I also thought that I should just kill myself to end the pain of the world. Life seemed so unreal and such a pattern that was not woth living for. It would not go away! I think I might try them again in a park with only a couple of people I'm very comfortable around.
