I have used for about 15 years now.  I had normal healthy food on all occasions and work out regularly and am physically fit.

The come-up on .5-1 gram is slow. After 1 hour I take another hit.  30 minutes later the teeth are grinding.  I stand up and know what's after all this: The come down. 

I had nothing happen in the first 48 hours.  I went to bed and there was a sharp ringing in my ears while lying there.  It was persistent until I finally fell asleep hours later due to exhaustion.  

The next morning was fine.  About 12pm vertigo kicked in for a moment, briefly I have the shakes and still am having hot flashes that cause sweating.  I then went about my day.  In the evening I took what was left of my party favorite, and felt great sipping on some ice water watching a movie.  Sexual thoughts are at an all-time high, however the male performance from such high doses are not to my liking :/  not matter what! so charming a woman is great, if I want to get giggled about later!

The next day all is well-  16:00 vertigo kicks in again this time a bit longer and more intense.  I feel nauseous but get up and move around - vertigo gone! There are still the hot flashes.   

This goes on and on for about 5 more days.  The ringing stops at night.  The vertigo persists.  Day 9 still vertigo but not as frequent.

Day 10!  mild case of vertigo, but all in all feeling better, more concentrated and the mind is more clear than ever.  I am ready to do it again, but I noticed that after consuming one alcoholic drink, I had a killer headache.  

I have now had this 5 out of 5 times. and still the vertigo!  I hope I didn't finally overdo it.  I go to the doctor in a few days.
