I've been a regular ketamine user for about a year. I took a break of about two years when my trips would end with horrible insomnia and anxiety. I was also starting to see conpiracys against me which where totally insane when I think back.

Had a few drinks last night, did a few lines of speed, and decided to IV some K. I've read a few accounts of people IVing K, but it is not recommended and seen as dangerous / unpleasant.. But I still decided to have a go.

##EROWID_NOTE:NOT_WEIGHED##

Eyeballed a nice pile of pure ketamine xtals and dissolved in saline by adding some heat and stirring. Filtered through a piece cotton and drawn up in the syringe. The remaining solution was very clear and a little thick.

Inserted the needle in a big vein in the crook of my elbow, drew back, and slowly pressed the plunger. 

When I withdrew the needle I could feel a little lightheaded but after about five seconds I started to hear bells ringing not unlike those heard when doing cocaine shots or a big dose of nitrous. All colours started to warp and a collapsed on the sofa.  It was an instant K-hole. I could not move and almost blacked out, I also can't remember much of the trip.. It was to intense and overpowering.

The experience seemed to last about an hour but total time was about 10 minutes. A definite hangover was present: headache, nausea and instant depression for about an hour.

Conclusion: shooting K is way too intense and short lived, the trip was so powerful that it left me humbled and confused.
