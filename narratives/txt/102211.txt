Reality

The room was lit by a black light and ominous whites would submerge from every known and unknown crevice. As it began to awake my eyelids became a kaleidoscope of colors never seen in a motion that could not be geometrically described. Breathing became cold winds through dark caves that echoed with a beautiful reverb off the silver metallic walls. The red, dark dark red, blanket rippled and pumped like veins as the shadows cast from the tip of the waves made an archaic countenance that smiled with some sort of desire. 

As I floated up from my back to sit on the edge of this mass my hair began to sweat and melt like thousands of gelatin ice sickles with no points. As I ran my hands through the ice sickles I could tell no difference between my hair and my sweat or if there was an end to my hair at all. As I focused on breathing I soon realized there was no difference between inhale and exhale and that I was only living. 

I opened my eyes soon to realize this new reality seemed so familiar. The textures of the wood grain separated themselves from the brown metallic squares they were attached to. The clothes on the floor filled as if they had bodies but there were no bodies. One of the bodies had been flattened in half by some sort of tread mark that left no tread except on the invisible body. The little bunches of hairs that made up the carpet melted into something like serpent skin and pumped like blood as I felt it under my feet. My hands rubbed together and felt like a waterfall of slimey sandpaper in which touch was absolutely euphoric. My skin illuminated a magical blue through the strange symbols that were all over my body. 

I soon closed my eyes to step back over to this even stranger place we live in every day. Reality.
