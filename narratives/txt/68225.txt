My first trip on mushrooms was really intense and hard to comprehend but I'm going to try and remember as many facts as I can.

I had always wanted to hallucinate off drugs and I thought it would be tight to eat some shrooms. It was so much more than I would have ever expected. I went to my sisters house and met up with my good friend Brendin. Brendin is older than me and I wanted him to be my trip-sitter because he was well experienced with drugs. So I got a cup of soda, sat on the couch, and washed down 1/8 of shrooms. About 30 minutes later I started to feel really anxious. I went inside and layed down on the couch. I felt like I couldn't move or think. My thoughts were going so fast. There were a few other people there and the T.V. was on. The sounds from the t.v. and the people were mixing together and I could swear my cell phone just kept ringing and ringing. Then I heard something about paramedics when I was trippin' on the couch with my eyes closed. This set me off, I thought I had poisoned myself and died. But I wasn't afraid, I thought I was floating to heaven and I felt just so comforted like nothing mattered anymore. Then someone nudged me and I came to and realized I was alive. I couldn't believe it! I for sure thought that I was going to heaven. Then I stood up and stumbled back to a room and layed down. When I closed my eyes I felt like I was going through a journey in my head. It's like I could see things but not really. The only thing I remember seeing when my eyes were closed was a pair of black dice spinning with red lines. The last thing I remember that I kept doing was thinking of the phrase "you should" over and over in my head.
