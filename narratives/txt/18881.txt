Last weekend was the first time i have every tried e. I got it for $20 from someone at school. I smoke pot almost everyday and i've taken shrooms before. My first time experience with e was fucking amazing. I have never felt so good in my whole life. I loved everyone and everything. Water... omg water was fucking awesome. I remember drinking some water and it never tasted so good. My skin felt like play doh. Coming up was a little scary for a few min cause I didn't know what to expect but then I was loving it. It was the biggest rush. I could not stop saying 'Oh my fucking god'. Once I peaked it was the most amazing feeling. The only flaw I can see with this drug is that it doesn't last forever lol. I felt sad coming down and I wanted more. Thank god I didn't have more on me. I would've at them like candy. This is definitely my favorite drug I have ever tried and can't wait to try it again.
