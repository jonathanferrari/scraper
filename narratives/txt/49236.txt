[December 24th - The Next Day.] - This is where I was unable to continue updating the experience report live. So I am having to come back now and fill in the gaps.

After my last entry, things became quite intense. I experienced what I would call a vision of sort. I saw three beings, or entities. One I understood its name to be 'The Everseeing Eye', and looked like a floating eyeball with eyelid turned on its side with a brownish-green aura around it. I understood it to be sort of the witness to the experience of mescaline. Like whether it is a good or bad experience, it is there to watch you. 

Another was what I understood to be, 'The One' and I understood it to be sort of like a judge over whether or not you will be blessed with a good or bad experience. It looked like some sort of Hawaiian ritual mask or something, a floating one that is.

Then there was the last entity, the one I understood to be known as, 'Sin'. I understood it to be what 'The One' uses to grant you a bad experience if it deems you deserve it or not. 'Sin' looked like a completely black head with a cut in its forehead and one, red, menacing eye.

These entities are what I understood to be the entities of the cactus. Before I had ingested the cactus, I said a quick Shamanistic Prayer, if you will to grant me a good experience and sure enough, I was given one.

I spent the entire time after this vision drawing the entities and writing down everything I could remember from the vision before I was overwhelmed and forgot or something.

After writing down everything I could remember, I put on some KoRn and listened to music for about 4 hours. 

The effects are still felt even as I type this. Mescaline is a very strong drug and should not be taken lightly.
