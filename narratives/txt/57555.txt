We had a gram of hash that was hard to scrape into filings for smoking.  I've always been adverse to smoking anything, so I suggested we try making hash tea.

We wrapped the cube in a cloth and smashed it with a hammer with one blow.  There being four of us I heated 4 cups of water in a saucepan to a boil, reduced heat to a simmer, and added the crushed cube.  Unscientifically, I simply let it simmer until an amber colour developed, which was about 30 minutes.

I portioned the brew into the cups and we sipped slowly as we conversed.  It tasted slightly bitter but actually it was rather good.  At first, we thought the experiment was a failure.  But, as we continued to socialize there came a point within 30-60 minutes where we realized that we were already in an altered state.  It sort of crept up on us unawares. Most pleasant.
