I had been wanting to try mushrooms for a long time. I had already been an alcoholic, stoner, and coke head (in that order). It was time to hallucinate. I drove to the city where I was going to purchase mushrooms at a really good price, so it was worth the drive. I picked them up and me and a few friends went cosmic bowling. I decided that eating a little bit wouldn't hurt. I had tried them once before this experience but it was nothing extraordinary.

I ate a couple grams in the bathroom and went back out. It's unfortunate that we left just as they started to kick in because the cosmic bowling place was insane. I think the lights and drawings on the walls would have been a cool part of a hallucination. 

I didn't expect 2 grams to change my thoughts. I made up a person in my head that was telling me the actual meaning of life. I knew that the person wasn't real but I was so convinced that she/he was right. I thought I was a meaningless organism that deserved to die. I probably would have hung myself then if I was functioning properly. I stared at my hand, hallucinated, seeing different angles, etc. I had a thought that movies, cars, and all that were just in a series of technology that 'we' distributed through the minds of scientists to make people think that the world is progressing. 

I 'went back to my body' and my mind said, 'It's okay, you can go back now, we've explained it all.' I was petting a cat and felt connected to it because I had black nail polish on and the cat was black. I felt like animals knew exactly what I knew, which sort of sounds a bit nuts now. 

I would say that my experience wasn't exactly a 'glowing' experience or anything, but it almost felt like an out of body experience. I had to go home and talk to people and act normal and it totally ruins the high.
