cube incense:
chew, swallow.
sit tense;
It will follow.
the Mind elastic
random and
misfiring. No
bones & skull --
this Poison
fit for
consumption,
then consummation.
yield, submit to
wonder.
wander
in willows
while windows
you hear
scraping; noises.
but only you.
Trees fight slow
twisting to Light
with lips you
know open up
to swallow too
will it swallow you?
was that tiger i saw real --
it very well was
since nothing happened
you could be lying
and though i am dying
i'm leaving with
every neuron firing
so come to me
caps veils and stems
	i like what you do
please
	could you do it again?
