Quicky

This weekend a friend of mine came in my room and informed me that we were going to Atlanta to see some buddies of mine. Fortunate enough I had already planned on going to atlanta so I could rail some K with a few friends. 3hrs later we arrived and wasted no time. First we smoked a bowl of kb and came back to the dorm. At say 12am we decided to prepare everything and get everything setup for a good trip. We layed out the powder, previously dried from a .5g vial, and set out our 1/3's.

I railed 3 lines between two nostrals. Oh dear god. I snort everything if given the chance, personally I dont believe in oral or injections. This was the worst burn I have ever felt in my life. Soon enough though, within a minute, I was already feeling that buzz. This stuff came and kicked me in my ass! I went and layed down, and waited for the music to come. In the mean time I just sat back and took a glance at the world to which I was sitting in at this moment. I looked at my friends and their face, it was elongated and completely blurry; the only way I could tell was by the color of their hair and one was wearing a hat. At this moment I knew I was fucked.

As I was entering the k-hole I couldnt think about anything at all; mind completely blank, soul completely free. I noticed, like with any drug, my speech became REALLY slow and was inable to complete sentences. Here's the bummer though, I had no hallucinations at all. In some sense, I must say that I was disappointed in the way of which I had expected visuals. Even though my body felt extremely thick and light, I saw nothing extremely strange. The whole surrounding was blurry, even the digital clock was moving back and forth. The best feeling I felt that night was just sinking into the couch. It felt as though I had sank some 2ft down into the couch.

The music was blaring, techno running through my head with its random noises and beats. At one point, every time a bass line hit, my head would feel as though it was trying to blow up. I was still not tripping yet. I was afraid that it wouldnt come, so I went ahead and closed my eyes. This I must say was a bit strange. After seeing a myriad of colors spread across my infinite plane of vision, I started to see things in as a wire frame. Basically everything that came to mine, looked like it had been drawn on autocad. I remember seeing a bed, tiny, and there were several colors; each line being a different color. Then came a car, and a house, etc. It was like I had became an architect or something. Sad to say, my time was coming to an end. Expecting a 2 hour trip, I managed to last some 30 minutes. Of all of the things I remember from the last parts of my trip, was a song. Stairway to heaven kind of popped into my head. If you've ever heard the song, you'd know in the end quotes, 'And as we wind on down the road, Our shadows taller than our souls'. I was trying my hardest to see what he meant by a shadow being taller than a soul. Oh well, needless to say, I had a fun trip, even though it didnt last as long as I had anticipated. I end by saying, take what you've got and use it for all it's worth. I really should have taken a lot more, maybe some 300mg. I get this because I have tripped several times before and know that I need higher doses.

Positives:
-Didnt make me sick at all, even after I sobered up.
-Powerful trip, definately unique.
-Not physically draining.

Negatives:
-Horrible nasal drip.
-Insanely harsh burn if insuflated.
-Short Trip.

[Author estimates they used a total of 150mg during their experience]
