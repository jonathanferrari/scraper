amazing experience

I began to feel the effects an hour after ingestion of a liquid hit dropped on a sugar cube. At first I saw mild distortions of shapes and objects began to look funny. Shortly after I had stopped writing in my journal because I believed it would be better to fully enjoy the experience and forget about logging the details.

My senses were mixing with everything around me. I tasted lights. I felt as if everything around me was a flowing texture of sensory data and emotion. I felt heavenly. Everything felt right. I felt like I was doing the right things with my life, and that I was treating people the way they should be treated. I could not understand at the time how someone might have a bad trip on this stuff.

I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I ignored most aspects of the visual hallucinations and focused on what intrigued me the most. It felt extremely spiritual.

This was a very profound experience, but I was in a safe setting and it lasted 12 hours.

The next day, I felt charged. I feel like quitting drinking, and I feel motivated and goal-oriented. I feel 'fixed'. I am confident. I do not regret it the least bit.
