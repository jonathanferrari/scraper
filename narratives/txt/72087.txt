For quite some time, I've been reading up on Mushrooms. Many times I've wanted to experience this life-changing substance. I wanted to be in awe of my physical and mental state, like so many others have. Unfortunately, this was not the case. 

I took about 3 grams of Gold Cap Mushrooms, along with 4 of my buddies. Suprisingly, they had almost no taste, so I put it down rather quickly. I was incredibly nervous as you can expect, seeing as it was my first time. I really didn't want a bad trip, so I needed to relax. We sat down and started to play some NES. 

About a half hour into it, I definitely started to feel something. I became incredibly comfortable and all of my worries had passed. All of sudden, everything became funny. I expected this part, because I had read about it so many times.

Well, that's kind of where my story ends. Everything was funny for about an hour, but I experienced absolutely no visuals whatsoever and my mind was astonishingly clear for the entire experience. All of my buddies were experiencing some crazy visuals and talking like maniacs, but to be completely honest I saw nothing out of the ordinary. Perhaps I need to take more next time, even though I weigh only 150 pounds. 

It was a good overall experience, but honestly I expected more.
