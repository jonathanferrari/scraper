A Trip to LSD Land

My friend had just got back from harvestfest with 50 bomb doses, blotter. I went over his house and we ate the doses at about 9 pm. We had split a 5-strip in half, so about 2.5 doses each.

No one we knew had ever tried this batch before, we were going to be the first. 30 minutes after consumption, I could feel the L coming on very strong as I would notice some movement in my peripherals.

After smoking a bowl of marijuana, the L came on full force and started to woop my ass. I done L only a couple times before this and I can assure you, this time was nothing like the other ones.

I became paralyzed and glued to my friends bed. I lay there motionless experiencing an incredible false reality with everything moving to its own personality. Surfers on posters were riding huge waves, shag rugs danced uncontrollably, everything morphing in its own uncontrollable manner. Amidst the heavy, heavy visuals were incredible colors, which I can best describe as colors one would see on a sweet blacklight poster.

Everything seemed almost cartoon-ish. Very beautiful.

Intense anxiety, jaw and muscle tensions were overwhelming. I had been clenching a lighter in my hand for over 3 hours and didnt even realize it!

Long story short, the entire trip lasted over 16 hours and I didnt get a blink of sleep until 12 pm the following day.The after effects lasted a couple days.

It was the most intense psychedelic experience I've ever had, and I dont think I would trip that hard again if I had a choice. I've tripped since this occasion several times, but again, the effects of all those times were nothing compared to this one experience.
