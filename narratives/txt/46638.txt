Having taken very small doses of Ketamine after various rave parties over the last year or so (mainly to help me come down from Ecstasy and amphetamine), and having enjoyed the relaxing and mildly euphoric effects, I was keen to try a much larger dose of this drug whilst I was more straight headed.

I was fascinated by reports I'd heard from other people and had read online of trips to other worlds.

Cool...!

So, having bought a gram of what I knew to be extremely pure ketamine crystal, me and some friends sat round and snorted lines.

First line - I felt a bit numb, and a bit giddy and giggly. Some of my friends were stumbling about the place and we all thought our collective messiness was rather funny.

Second line (about 10 minutes later) - I felt a bit more numb, people really were staggering about now and other people in the group were telling them to sit down lest they hurt themselves.

Third line (about 15 mins later) - feeling really very numb now, difficult to move or even speak, slumped in a chair.

By this point, I was trying to will myself into the mysterious K-Hole experience I'd heard of so many times.  So, as soon as the third line had worn off sufficiently (probably about 20 mins, at a rough guess) I laid myself out a line considerably larger than the other ones I'd done.

An experienced ket user who was with me laughed and said I should sit down nice and quickly, because I'd certainly be on my way to the K-Hole now.  I sat down and waited.  After a couple of minutes, I felt the numbness come back but this time, very quickly.  I closed my eyes.

Nothing happened :( I just blacked out!

I woke an hour later and was asked if I was OK.  Apart from feeling thirsty and numb, I was.

Perhaps I did too much, or not enough?
