My first time with mushrooms

My first time with Mushrooms, me and my friend 'T' went camping and we decided to get an 8th of mushrooms. We ate the mushrooms at about 6:30. In about 15 minutes I started to feel the affects.

The very first thing that we noticed was that everything was 'different'in some way. We started thinkng up crazy things and they didnt make any scense. Since we were outside everything felt so alive, and that we were connected to nature in some way. I started to draw in my sketch book, and my pictures were very strange. My friend said that he felt curious so he put a handful of dirt in his mouth. We tripped for a good many hours when my favorite part of the trip happened my friend had handed me a piece of a tree(a branch) when for some reason it felt like a gun in my hands, and for some reason my friend started running, and I thought I was in vietnam and my friend was the enemy, and I wasnt sure if I was supposed to shoot him or not. I felt like I was in a video game! Afterwords we started to come down, and we couldnt go to sleep till about 1:30.
