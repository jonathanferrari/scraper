I wrote a poem about my experience on MDMA at a rave, who knows, I just took it about 13 hours ago.

this endless bliss...
it's like everything is beautiful 
and I am innocent...
It's as though all is joy 
and I can feel ...   
The being of others
The being of myself  
The being of the world and all it's people
and everything is close to me 
 and beautiful and 
 I am innocent and I am happy 
bliss of bliss this endless bliss this perfect state of being
this comes from a pill..... 
this endless bliss....
