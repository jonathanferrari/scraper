K so I got some free dmt about 100 mg mixed in with some grinded up weed I was at my buddys house when I got this stuff I threw it into my homemade pipe (air compressor parts) I know ur supposed to vaporize dmt but I was to lazy to go get tinfoil from the store so instead I just made sure not to touch the flame directly to it and turned the bowl side ways and smoked it traditional opium style (worked better than u would think)

I took one massive rip and held it and let my buddy hit it while I was still holding mine in when I blew it out I immediately felt this tingling awesome crazy sensation throughout my body I took another hit and held it (this shit taste terrible like melting plastic) I think I let my buddy hit it again but I cant remember but after that I was to high to pass the pipe so I just kept hitting it while the universe opened up to me lol I was sitting on my buddys bed and directly across from me were 2 closets and both doors were open except to me they werent doors or closets .....they were portals lol in one I could see the whole entire earth down to the last atom I knew all and saw all this was my planet in the other portal I could see everything in the universe and I controlled it all ....I WAS GOD!!!

For like 20 mins but felt like centuries I almost got up and went into the universe portal but choose not (good thing I would got trapped in that mother fucker lmao) I also during this time created a new color which no other human being has ever seen but this is normal for me as I have done this on acid and shrooms lol after I came back down I found myself repeating the words 'this is beautiful' over and over again until I could control my mouth enough to stop I looked around at my friends and just started bustin up laughing and then I felt like I was really stoned for like 4 hours and I know it wasnt the weed the dmt was on cuz that was just shit ass mexican reg it was a very intense trip I plan on doing it again...... Especially since 4 ft tall phalaris aquatica field is right next to my house >:)
