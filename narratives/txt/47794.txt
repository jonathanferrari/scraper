I had done this drug before, in moderate amounts, that I had found to be very safe and functional in mild amounts -  a small bump at the top of a pen can produce effects to being slightly drunk yet very entusiastic and energetic.  The effects would only last about twenty minutes, so the only nuisance was to find a private place to redose.  I always preferred this drug due to the fact that it was so easy to control your level of intoxication - rarely did I take it too far...

However, after a while, I did feel inclined to test the limits...

I took then, all at once, probably about 1/3rd of the forty jar, and the first thing I noticed was an immense dizzying perception..everything about me was spinning, and eventually I wasn't able to recognize fellow people in the room...after a few minutes, I saw, in front of me, icons of me and two of my friends, and, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out which one of them I might be...am I jane? Am I rachel?  Or am I me?  Sounds silly, but for about half an hour, I really couldn't not only decipher the difference between these beings, but was equally convinced I could have been any one  of them.  My own sense of self had ceased to exist, and it took a few hours to regain my sense of self and to realize who exactly I was.  The interesting thing was that it wasn't scary, in fact, it was quite interesting, and I don't regret doing it.  I have also have had friends that have had near death experiences with this, that have not been able to handle them in the opimistic way that I have.   I love this substance, and regret that it is highly controlled.
