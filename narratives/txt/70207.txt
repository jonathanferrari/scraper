Having grown up very introverted I still managed to have a small group of friends and a couple girlfriends in my life throughout high school and into college. However, I always feel somewhat out of place among even good friends at times, and have a lot of anxiety in approaching much of anyone outside of those familiar to me. I've somehow gotten by just fine, but when my girlfriend of 1.5 years left me, I was left pretty heartbroken and clammed up to the world. A few months later, I decided I was going to branch out and just have an awesome 20th birthday.

So I planned a get-together with my friends and family during which I was going to go skydiving for my first time. Beforehand we chilled and grilled steaks together, I went for my jump, it was incredible, and on the way home I talked with one of my friends about doing ecstasy that night. What a day. I have never done any drug in my life, nothing past sniffing sharpies in middle school, and have only been drunk
