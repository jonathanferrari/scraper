I took about 40mg using "the machine" and our survival perspective of reality immediately peeled straight off.

I found myself in an infinitely dense, viscous underlying energy realm where every inch was filled with consciousness and what I felt were infinite independent entities.

The entities were welcoming, I felt them saying "Oh! Welcome hoooooooome! So glad you escaped the ape perspective again!"
I went in wanting to learn, so I asked them "Can you please teach me something, anything, I feel like I'm ready", they responded "Well, we all know everything...why don't you just...synchronise?"
I responded "Synchronise? Hmm, I'll try..."

As soon as I focused, the web of entities surrounding me began firing beams of light containing some form of information directly into my mind, reconnecting me. I could feel an actual physical pressure in my head during the "upload".

Sadly the trip ended before the "upload" had completed, and I'm unsure if I really bought anything back. I need to return, soon.
