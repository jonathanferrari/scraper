I slowly injected the half-milliliter into my vein, not really expecting much.  The next thing I remember is a very intense white light surrounding me.  I felt as if God were speaking to me, but not in words, and not in the same way I've experienced a divine communication on LSD.  This is strange because my concept of God was that of the Judeo-Christian persuasion, which is not my belief.  I am more of a Buddhist.  But in my experience it was the Judeo-Christian God.  I felt myself falling, I remember thinking I was dead and that my girlfriend's grandfather had found my body in the bathroom.  I then remember wondering if I were falling to hell, not necessarily feeling frightened though.  This too is odd as I do not believe in hell.  

Eventually I was able to see thru my eyes again and saw blood on my hand, not remembering taking the needle out or cleaning myself off or anything.  I remember feeling as if the experience was lasting much longer while I was in it, and as soon as it was over I knew that only about an hour had passed.  It was incredible and I will definitely experiment further via this method.
