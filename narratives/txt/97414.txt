It was late August when my husband, who I will call Z, and our mutual friend/ roommate M, decided to embark on our first mushroom trip. 

We had done some research in the past about all different kinds of substances, and M has tried several of them, but he hadn't done any psychedelics before. Z is a stoner, weed is his drug of choice. He drinks occasionally, and the only other substances he has experimented with were painkillers. Me, well I used to be a stoner, but then I started to get extreme anxiety after I smoked. So I just stuck with alcohol every once and a while. I was (and still am) very interested in psychedelics and other psychoactive substances. Oh, and I'll note that we all smoke cigarettes. So there is some background information about our previous drug usage.

So, here's how our adventure started. We decided to go camping for a couple of days. We decided that once we get there, we will set up camp, get a fire going, and then partake. When we got to the campground, we registered and picked up a bundle of firewood. Then we proceeded to unpack the car, and hike up a hill about a mile to where our remote campsite was. Everything was going according to plan, we set up our tents in a relatively short amount of time. (We got to the site around 1:00 pm.) By 2:00 we had our tents up, citronella candles lit, and a nice big campfire burning strong.

2:15 P.M. (approximately) We decided to grab out the baggie of shriveled little mushrooms, and the jug of orange juice. M and Z both take about 1.5 Â– 1.75 grams of the mushrooms, and I take around 1 gram, maybe a little bit more. We were all a bit nervous to trip, so we decided to stick with a low dose for our first experience. I remember chewing them up, and I thought the taste was pretty awful, I ended up chewing them quickly and washing them down with a huge gulp of orange juice. Z and M followed suit. 

2:30 P.M. We sit back in our lawn chairs and chit-chat about random things to take our minds off of waiting for the shrooms to kick in. I take out my sketch pad and drawing pencils and start to doodle while the boys talk. 

2:35-3:00 P.M. From now on times are approximate, since we turned off our cell phones at this point, so I'm not sure at what time these events happened, but I can still sort of recall them in order. Now, at this point we are getting pretty giggly, M and Z both agree with me that they feel lightly stoned. It's hard to keep a straight face. Conversations get more in depth, we are laughing at basically everything. Not just regular laughter either, we are guffawing, straight up gut-busting laughter. It was incredible; I don't think I have laughed so hard for so long in my entire life! I decide to write down all the funny things that are being said in my sketchbook, to recall the quotes later, this was a good idea.

3:00-?? Cracking jokes and laughing like maniacs aside, I started to notice strange thoughts come into my head, and I looked up at the leaves of the white birch trees overhead, and noticed that they seemed to shimmer in the sunlight. It was beautiful! M reports that he is feeling sober at one point, and then completely tripping at another point, he commented on this throughout the evening. Z and I felt it too, so we agreed with M.
 
??-10 P.M. I'm just going to summarize the rest of this, it's been so long I can't really remember all the other things that I had felt at the time! Basically, we felt some time dilation, minutes felt like hours, etc. Colors seemed a bit brighter and to me the forest felt "alive". I think the best part was when the trip was just about to die down, the fireflies came out, and I swear they were glowing to the beat of the music. It was beautiful. 

I have taken mushrooms twice after this first experience, just small doses again, but hopefully before the summer ends I will be prepared to take a few more grams than I have last time.
