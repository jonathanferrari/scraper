4 days ago I took a e, not sure how much or how big it was :P, I wasnt dancing or anything, just watching tv and listening to music, everything went fine. The next day I had no hang over, I went out for few hours but when I came home I felt tired. I just had to take off my clothes and rest. Since then I've been feeling a bit tired in my eyes and closing them was pretty uncomfortable the first night, it felt like I was focusing on something really close to the eyes. Its been getting better since then and a little fever now and then. I think my eyes might take a little longer to adjust to brightness and I feel like weird pains (not very unfomfortable though) here and there in my body. Since english isnt my first language, then the last part could be irritability?

Sometimes I feel very sad too (it gets shorter every day, first day it was maybe an hour, today it was just few minutes), few hours ago I was wondering if I had become crazy and if I would stay like this for the rest of my life, after I read however that the hangover could be for up to few weeks I felt a little better (feeling like this for weeks is gonna suck though hehe) I feel normal now :P The only thing I'm still not sure is 'normal' are those weird 'pains' (its not really pain, that was just the only word I could think of) I get sometimes (irritability maybe?)
