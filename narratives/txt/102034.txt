A few months ago I took shrooms for the third time. This trip was unlike any other that I experienced with psychedelics. At first it was amazing. It was extremely intense and I felt like I was on top of the world. But after what seemed like a second (in reality it was about 1 1/2 - 2 hours) the trip went horribly bad. I'd heard of bad trips and I'd even been with a friend who was experiencing one. But like many other people who use psychedelics I thought myself immune to bad trips. There's no way to explain how bad this trip was other than the fact that it was the most afraid I'd ever been. It felt like my mind was a pure manifestation of fear and there was nothing I could do to stop it. The main thing I remember from the trip was that there was a recurring theme. I thought that everything was wet, soaking wet. I had no ability to differentiate between dry and wet. It was insane. Eventually my trip partner and I left where we were hoping to psyche ourselves out of the bad trip (he was also experiencing a bad trip, though not to the extent that I was). I went in to the bathroom and I was successful in psyching myself into a good trip. We went into a room that was very colorful and the trip was amazing from then on. 

Flash forward to current day. Since taking those shrooms I have had the exact same feeling of wetness. It isn't perpetual; it comes in spells. But it is the scariest feeling. Whether this is HPPD or not I do not know but what I do know for sure is there is still something there from that trip. That feeling pops up every now and then and it's insanely frightening. I dont think I'll ever do another psychedelic drug again in my life.
