New Years First Time Pill Awesome 

Never done anything before, hate smoking and dont even drink a lot. I had new years day off work so I was keen for a big night. Been considering pills for quite some time as alcohol makes me tired and I just get rather bored. I like to dance a lot and am pretty outgoing. Got a mates house party of about 30 people, so not a huge crowd.

8pm- 9pm Had three standard drinks felt a little tipsy, had one mdma capsule, my mate told me it was fairly pure although I really have no idea.

+40mins still waiting to come up.

+50mins, came up very quickly but smoothly, I didnt feel sick at all, I felt really happy and excited and really really thirsty! Went for a ride in a car which was fun and everyone smelt really nice and I wanted to kiss them on the neck In one hr I drank two bottles of powerade which tasted great and was mostly sitting walking around.                        

+2hrs still high feeling really energetic and was told my pupils look huge. I was talking heaps which I realised but couldnt seem to stop. My short term memory was getting really bad and I was frequently going from one conversation to another losing interest. Had two more bottles of water I just sipped regularly. My temperature was crazy, when I went outside I was instantly cold and my arm hairs stood up, when I went back inside I then got warm again very quickly.                               

By 3hrs I was starting to feel tired and noticed my jaw hurt a bit, I think from the talking. By              

+3.5hrs I felt like I was sober but temperature was still crazy. The next day +12hrs still really tired and pretty thirsty and not really hungry. E was everything I hoped for but I wish it lasted a bit longer. One of the best experiences but disliked being tired the next day.
