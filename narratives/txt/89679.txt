Greatest Poisoning Ever

It was one mushroom.  I didn't think I should 'put all my eggs in one basket' by eating only one, but the fucker weighed six grams, dry, so I said what the hell.  

It took a long time to set in; I didn't chew it up like I should have.  We watched SNL, waiting for them to kick in.  I was feeling moderately trippy, but nothing mind blowing. 

Then it hit me.  My body temperature jumped what felt like thirty degrees; I was sweating my ass off.  My hands and arms began to tingle.  Then the visuals hit.  It was a myriad of kaleidoscopes I could not concentrate on...I thought I better lay down to get my bearings.  I laid down on the bed and immediately felt better.  Began watching 'Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach.'  After the visuals subsided a bit, I was able to concentrate on the movie.  And it was hilarious.  After that movie ended I watched Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. I was so enamored by the colors and details, I couldn't follow the story.  Ended the night listening to the Ipod.  The music was unbelievable. I tripped with my significant other and couldn't help but realize my paranoia, though. Paranoid thoughts ran rampant for a couple hours. I guess that's why McKenna called 5g + a heroic trip. Don't think this amount could have been done in a social setting.... 

The night was spent watching movies; I don't think I would have been capable of anything else.  I am a psilocybe veteran and this is without a doubt the most mind blowing experience I have ever had.  And it was one mushroom!!  This was the third flush of a liquid culture produced casing.  I guess the fungus is getting stronger as I am getting older.  

All in all, one of the best experiences on psilocybin in my lifetime.  Don't know if it can be matched. Gonna lower the dose a bit for next time; I like scaring the shit out of myself, but only every so often.  And this time, I definitely hit that mark.
