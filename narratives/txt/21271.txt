Well last night it was cold and rainy. I was alone, just broken up with my girlfriend. I was sad, very depressed.... Not only beecause we broke up, but it was also glomy and rainy out. Well I had a few of these pills left from a party this past weekend. They are double stacked yello gators. Now I would never roll alone, but I was in a terrible mood and E has always lifted me up to a happy mood.

Well it was about 7:30 so I took both pills with a whole bottle of water. I sat and waited for about 45mins, then I started feeling the stoney roll come up, so I got up and started walking around. I felt like I was going to fall over, I started to feel worse. So I went and drank a glass of milk. The feeling went away, like nothing had happened, so I thought to myself 'I did not just waste 2 fuckin pills'. So I sat down and watched MTV, this was about 8:30. Around 8:45 I had this strange feeling crawling up my back, at 9pm like on the dot I started rolling hard, like I've never rolled before.

I turned all the lights off and turned on the black lights, and some loud music. I danced by myself till 10:30, it felt like 10 mins. At about 10:45, I decided to go outside (forgeting it was raining). I went into the backyard, everytime a rain drop hit my face I just felt like I was in heaven. It was the best feeling of my life. So I took my shirt off and laid on the ground, the clod concret felt amazing, and the rain drops hitting my body were even better. I was in heaven, I thought I died and went to heaven, seriously. I laid there till 4:30am, then I went inside and dried off. Roll started to crash down hard about 5am, so I smoked some weed to ease the fall, and I fell right to sleep. I woke up at 12:50 feeling great, except for having a sore throat and stuffed nose. It didnt bother me anymore that me and my g/f had broken up, I relized that it was for the best and that I'm young and I need to have fun. Well thats my trip report, enjoy!
