A few months ago, me and 2 of my friends, call them S and B, decided to do MDMA for the first time. B got 4 pills, and came to my house, which was open for the day. Originally, me and S, who were both first timers, were both going to take 1 pill each and B was going to just chill, but he ended up taking the other 2 pills. 

Me and S took our pills around 11 AM, and B took his a little after. So after about 30 minutes, we started to feel different, so me and S sat down in a dark hallway and B gave us a lightshow while we listened to The Stone Roses. Then the pills really started kicking in for me and S. I was getting very, very talkative, and was mostly talking to B. Right off the bat, S got pretty emotional and started talking about how much he loves his sister and talking about the girl he likes. This was kind of messing with his roll so we sat down and basically decided to live in the moment. This is when things started really getting amazing, because B was starting to peak too. For the next 2 or so hours, we just went from my backyard, to my hallway, to my room, to other places in my house. We would make a circle and hold hands and just talk about our feelings, for life, each other, etc. (I feel the need to point out that we are all straight men, and have never emotionally felt that way). 

What happened that day truly has stuck with me since then, and I am very glad I experienced it. People call MDMA a party drug, but I really don't think it is.
