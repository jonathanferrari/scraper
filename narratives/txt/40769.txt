I used to smoke weed almost every day so I am familiar with it.  I quit weed and decided to get some yesterday.  Today is my first day smoking in a while.

I am home alone and in a good mood.  I have about 5 hours before my cousins get home and my car is snowed in. At 2:30 I take 2 hits.  I feel relaxed and energetic so I dance around and chase my dog at full speed through the house.  I feel a closer connection to my dog, like I understand her better and like she understands me.  It seemed likes she understood english.  At 3:30 I do the same.  I get another energy burst.  4:30 I take 2 more hits and I just feel the same as how I have felt since 2:30.  By 5:30 I decide I am not as sensitive to weed as I used to be so I go take two more hits, but this time I take large hits.  

This is where it started to really really kick in.  I began realizing that I was extremely stoned and I had that oh so familiar feeling.  I was paranoid yet happy at the same time.  I was so happy to be stoned again but scared I wasnt going to come down early enough.  My heart was racing and I had an extreme body high.  I went to the bathroom and could barely button my pants up because I couldnt feel anything.  It was the best body high.  I felt somewhat out of it but I was still thinking like how I normally thinking when I am not stoned, I just had a tendency to space out between my moments of lucidity.  Right now it is 915 and I am feeling relatively normal.  I am feeling laid back and content.  My muscles still feel good even though I do not have a body high.  Weed has proven to relieve me of my muscle spasms while I am stoned and afterwards my muscles feel slightly better as well.  Weed not only soothes my muscles but also my mind.  If I would say the best description of weed would be a refreshment.  Weed doesnt make me feel stupid or crappy during the high or the come down.  It is extremely refreshing.
