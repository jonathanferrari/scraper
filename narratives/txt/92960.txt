Took 1.4 grams of mdma crystal and was off my face completely. My jaw was rattling up and down so violently that I knocked a tooth out of place. An my eyes were bouncing round 180 degrees. Which at times was very strange. I couldnt focus on anything at all. They were going side to side and up and down every 3 seconds it seemed. An on the come up spewed hard an was rushing so hard it felt amazing. 

But days afterwards my mouth is still bone dry with ulsers all over my tongue. And I have a strange sort of light headed headache constantly. An my memeory is that of a goldfish I'm forgeting everything like wat I have walked upstairs for an stuff like that. 

Overall it was an awesome buzz but I feel I shouldnt feel this bad still at 4 days ago I took it.
