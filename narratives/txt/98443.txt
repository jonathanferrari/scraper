The following report is a short exerpt of an MDMA experience I had alone with a 160mg (120mg + 40mg) dose. Here it is:

Setting was a home in my unit by myself. No other medications used besides MDMA and I have no medical history. 

1215. 120mg capsule taken after eating 1.5 hours ago.

1230. Feeling tingly. Took a little left over from a cap. Probably 10mg or so.

1250. Feeling a bit of a rush, just subtle at the moment. Hands getting a bit sweaty.

1258. Definitely feeling the rush creeping up on me now! Looking around fast, feeling content :) Decided to play a game of black ops. Had to put the aircon on as I noticed the temperature a bit, not uncomfortable but more comfy with the aircon on. 

1325. Really feeling it kicking in now. Waves of euphoria and pleasure. Feeling completely at ease with myself and everything around me.

1330. Have started to come up on the peak. Feeling pretty happy. Working through a few personal issues with my girlfriend, able to examine them easy and gain some good perspective. 

1418: Just chilling here and listening to music. Feeling really content. Have definitely gone through those issues I needed to go through and gained some valuable perspective on everything.

1438. Dosed 30mg more out of a cap probably 20 minutes ago. Feeling the peak now. They reckon 3 hours for a full peak so still got 30 minutes to go. Just playing cod and thinking to myself and just chilling. Good setting and choice to do this by myself :) No distractions just gonna game, have a few cigarettes and chill at home till training tonight :)

1500. Just relaxed, sitting outside in a hammock. The last little bit I took has kept the peak going for a little bit.

1600. Pretty much come down from my peak now. Just feeling that warm afterglow that you get. 

1700. Feeling back to baseline.

Next day:

0800. Feel pretty much normal. Slept well around 8 hours. Feel slightly fatigued like I'd had a few drinks the night before but nothing much. Overall good experience yesterday.
