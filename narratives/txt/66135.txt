First Time Shrooms

Me and a few friends went to Amsterdam on holiday, we went over to sample some of the greenery and have a good time. As we arrive we started talking to some lads and they mentioned that you can buy magic mushrooms legally so we all decided to try them, I knew alot of my friends had tried them and they all raved on about them. We bought a box each of Mexican mushrooms we were told these are the best to try if its your first time because they are quite mild compared to others, when we took them we all put them in a burger and eat them about a hour passed and still nothing but really we didnt no what to expect we sat in our hotel room whilst we came up on them, we decided to walk to a coffeshop which was really trippy brightly coloured paintings all over the walls will chilled out bob marley music playing in the background.

All of a sudden they kicked in a strong feeling on nausea real bad almost like a churning feelin after about an hour and a half it leveled out feeling a little paranoid and a bit confused the walls feeling like they were moving closer each time I looked at the other wall all the colors looked real bright like they were lit up all my friends were laughing so much they started crying but this didn't happen to me bursts of nausea throughout my trip very unplesent and they people sitting around felt like they were all looking at me peoples voices sounded like shouting then when I looked at them it went very strange but after bout 5/6 hours things felt more normal and it slowly faded but the rest of the night my appetite went completely and I felt really really tired not the best experience but may try again but I will stay in my room.
