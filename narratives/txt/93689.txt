I am a college student who smokes marijuana every day. And I don't mean I have a bowl every night, I mean I smoke a lot of chronic often. My tolerance is without question extremely high. That said, last night I took a hit of hash through a hash piece. It was a good 7 second hit of incredible hash. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to immediately sit down I was so wrecked.

Then it got interesting. First, I was able to hear every conversation in a room. Its like my selected hearing didn't exist. I felt like I was getting sensory overload, similar to tripping.

Twice during a 3 hour period I felt like I was in a different place. The first time I imagined hard a future event, but it felt so real. The next time I had an incredibly real flashback to events from a few years ago. All this time I was still able to converse with friends in the room. 

Once it finally died down I realized without a doubt this was one of the craziest highs of my life. It was like one of the first times smoking again.
