##EROWID_NOTE:IMPURE_MDMA##

Background: I'm 18 years old. I am a frequent Marijuana and tobacco smoker, I occasionally drink, and I have tried Salvia, Shrooms, Coke, 2C-I, DXM, and alcohol. 

Setting: My apartment. Small, but cozy. After having been there only a month, it already feels like home. I was very comfortable in that situation.

Set: Apprehensive, but excited. I had bought the pill a few days earlier, and decided, mostly on a whim, that tonight would be a good night to take it.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
8:40 - Smoke a bowl of some KB.

8:45 - Call my friend T, who agreed to act as a sitter for me. He was at a barbeque, so I told him not to hurry. Then I call my friend M, who has had previous X expierience, to ask him a couple questions, including how long it would take to hit (around an hour), whether I should have cigs handy (definitely, they're a must), and whether I should have weed (not necessary, might be nice for come-down).

Note: From here on in, I transcribed my trip journal exactly as I wrote it down. Any notes are in parantheses.

8:55 - Dose with water 1 blue dolphin pill. Feeling apprehensive, and kinda stoned from the weed smoked approximately 15 min earlier. 

9:05 - Just rolled 9 cigs. Possibly feeling something? I don't really feel stoned, but I don't feel normal. Placebo effect?

9:08 - Call sitter (I was definitely not feeling normal. My exact words were 'This shit is hitting too fast. Get over here.')

9:11 - Go outside for cigarette (and to wait for T).

9:18 - Well, I think I'm definitely feeling it. I'm pretty fucking happy, and considering recent events, that's saying something. (I had recently gotten in a car accident and gotten arrested for my part in setting a forest fire.) I'm also getting some weird perspective changes. I find myself looking around, cause everything looks new and different. Getting some dry mouth, but I'm staying hydrated. (I had a 20 oz. Pop bottle that I filled with water. I would eventually drink 30-35 oz. Over the course of the night.) It's probably kicking in so fast cause I haven't eaten much of anything in the past couple days. Nothing else is in my system. (Except for the weed, but I have such a tolerance to it by this point that a bowl, smoked by myself, will only get me high for a half-hour or so.)

9:23 - Oh yeah, it's hitting. I feel amazing. Where the fuck is my sitter? I called him 15 minutes ago. (It's worth noting that my friend wasn't more than 15 minutes walking time, and he was with his girlfriend who had a car.)

9:26 - Put in Garden State (chosen because it's the only movie I know with a scene of people taking X). I feel like I'm floating when I walk. Spelling is hard. I'm writing too quickly to put all the letters down on paper. 

9:28 - My whole body is tingling. Everything seems to be going in slow motion, although sounds aren't distorted.

9:34 - Can't really feel my limbs anymore. I just feel like a tingly ball, or maybe an egg....(The best equivalent would be that pins and needles feeling you sometimes get in your arms and legs when the blood gets cut off or starts flowing again, but not in an annoying way.)

9:35 - The light keeps getting darker. Can't tell if its real or not. (The reason I noticed, and also the reason I wasn't sure if it was because of the drug, was because it became darker by a few degrees a few times in a row, with about 4-5 seconds in between.)

9:36 - Oh damn. I feel....I don't even know. (Good.)

9:37 - My vision keeps jerking around. Staying focused on anything is harder than its worth.

9:38 - Half an hour. What's taking him? I could be dead by now.

9:39 - Seems to be coming in waves. I don't feel like I did 3 minutes ago. Extreme tracers. Well, not extreme, but noticeable.

9:44 - False alarm on the piss. (I had gotten up to go to the bathroom, but after standing in front of the toilet for almost a minute, I abandoned the cause.)

9:46 - It's incredibly hard to focus on anything. My vision is jerking and blurring. However, the TV is unaffected.

9:53 - 45 minute mark. Fucker.

9:55 - I feel great. Vision is bouncing extremely fast. I can barely read my writing. 1 hour mark (since I'd taken the drug, not since I called my sitter).

10:08 - Ok, not cool. I called him an hour ago. I was gonna say something else, but I forgot what it was.

10:17 - The world just took on an orange tint.

10:23 - got a call from my sitter, is on his way. 1 hour 15 minutes after I first called, by the way.

10:25 - 1.5 hours since dosing

10:28 - If my teeth don't scare my dentist, he's in the wrong profession. I can't seem to stop grinding my teeth.

10:34 - My sitter finally arrives. (I did all the typical X things, despite telling myself I wouldn't. But I was so grateful that they finally arrived that I gave them both hugs, and was way nicer than I normally would be in this situation.)

11:07 - First time sitting down since my sitter arrived. (I had been standing previous to then, talking with T while he smoked a couple bowls. I had no interest in getting blazed.)

11:41 - order pizza. Currently listening to Incubus. (Their first CD, a must for any trip.) gonna try to study for my test tomorrow.

12:08 - Pizza gets here. I feel down. I thought this would last a bit longer, but quick to hit, quick to pass. I still feel it, but it just feels like I woke up from a good nap, as opposed to having a million ants massage me to orgasm.

12:56 - Smoking my first full bowl. Taken three hits off three different bowls, mostly cause of the taste. (This was the best tasting weed I'd had in a while, but until now, a hit for the taste was all I desired.)

1:37 - Leave for Perkins. Am down.

At this point, I stopped keeping the journal. We went to Perkins, which is open 24/7, and stayed there for maybe an hour, then left. I had two cups of coffee while there. When we got home, I got in bed, but I had no interest in sleeping. So I put on the Secret Machines CD, and after that was done, watched a movie. I went to my class at 9, after being up all night, mostly just sitting and waiting. We ended up not having a test, which was good, although I was surprisingly prepared for it. I found that I had an easier time understanding the material, although it was harder for me to associate concepts with names. 

After class, I went home, stayed up till about 1 PM, then crashed for about 2 hours, till some friends came over and woke me up. I didn't feel tired though, I felt fine. I slept fine that night, and haven't had a problem since. The one thing I did notice, was throughout that day, I would occasionally get the same feeling I got just prior to the really fast part of the come-up.

After doing some research here on Erowid, and elsewhere, I found dolphins, which contained meth, and blue dolphins, which contained caffeine. Since the blue dolphins looked exactly like the one I took, I'm going to assume they were the same thing. 

Conclusions - Well, I don't want to take one that contains meth, but I would definitely do a BD or something similar in the future. But it definitely requires vigilance. All I wanted to do on Tuesday (two days after I took it) was eat another. I have never felt so good in my life, and it would be very very easy to start taking these all the time.
