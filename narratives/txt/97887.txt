I tried acid at a rave for my first time. It was super weak I'm assuming because I didnt really 'trip.' We had also smoked 2 joints about an hour apart. Just felt like I should be at home watching family guy and falling asleep. I didn't want to dance or socialize. 

Strangely after this experience, it took me a good 8 1/2 months to suffer another migraine, and it wasn't AS bad as before (but then it started getting back to normal strength migraine). Which by the way, I don't know how you other migraine sufferers survive, but bless you all man keep fighting. Sometimes I feel like just squeezing the trigger and letting one through my skull during a migraine. Honestly I think I would actually do it, given I'm alone. 

I suffer a migraine about once a month. I now have 2 tabs from a very trusted friend. I'm just waiting for the right time to eat them, but it will definitely be in a forest and I will be in deep meditation. I love psychedelics and they love me and take care of me. 

One love
