I use 'magic' mushrooms harvested in central FL, dried in a hot air beef jerky machine.My usual oral dose is .8(8/10)gram to elevate mood and increase energy. 2grams produces mild visuals for me. I set aside .6(6/10)gram for smoking to submit a report. Sample was two small caps and several small stem pieces.All material was broken into small pieces and smoked through a single stage waterpipe with a 'one hitter' bowl. 

Resulted in 4 'hits' taken in a short period. Mild effects felt after 5-10 minutes (similar to small oral dose after 25-30 min) and diminished after 20 min (compared to oral dose diminishing after 120-150 min)

To compare, I took .5(5/10)gram catnip (works on the cat...) and smoked in the same manner and got much the same results.(Guess who's out of cannabis..)

Not a preferred method to ingest mushrooms for me.
