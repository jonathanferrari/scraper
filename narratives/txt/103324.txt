My After Effect Experience

After a great night rolling on .6 (I felt wonderful and also took about 6 bong rips on the comedown which brought me to a whole nother level. I had wiggly eyes and everything) I got about 4 hours of sleep and worked for 8 hours on a super busy day in a restaurant. 

I didn't feel too bad at work but once I was home and with my significant other, I started to feel very depressed and layed in bed thinking way too hard about life and convinced myself life is going to suck. The next day I felt fine and completely happy with my life again until I got back from work. I started getting weird 5-second headbuzzes that felt good? Kind of unexplainable. And again, while I was laying in bed, things got pretty weird. I was looking at the ceiling (pretty dark in the room) and I started seeing visuals. The ceiling started to look like a pool of water that was wavy/ripply and wherever I'd look it would follow with where I pointed my iris. I also started hearing dishes clashing when I would get close to falling asleep. (That could just be from working too much.) 

I'm assuming these are all after effects of the mdma though since I had been sober since I took it.
