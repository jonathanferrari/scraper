I'm in Bolivia right now I've experemented with San Pedro yesturday.

Two days ago I went to the Witch Markey in La Paz and bought a fresh cutting of San Pedro. I asked the lady who sold it to me for one normal dose. She sold me a 15cm by 5cm long piece and she recommended me cutting it to pieces like a salad, boil in in one litre of water for one hour, let the 'soup' simmer for another half an hour and than drink it. I followed her directions to the letter. I've experienced a really strong trip that lasted for 12 hours, 9 hours of were really intence with a lot of open eye helucinations. My pupils returned to their original size after 13 hours.

This experience contradicts the common information circeling the Net regrading dosage and preparation.

I thought you mighty find it interesting.

BTW. I have experience with psicodelics and I'm a big fella, the dose I've consumed was really substantioal.
