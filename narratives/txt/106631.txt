Went to an all day festival with a friend and took some MDMA with us. I'd had half a gram the week before with no bad side effects and a pill the week before that with the same. Both experiences were euphoric. This was around my 6th time trying MD. 

I snorted about an 8th of it at first and definitely felt high, but it was more wired  and I was still self conscious, paranoid and didn't get any euphoria or love. I just had loads of energy. We stayed up from 1pm until 7am when we went home but by this point wed done an entire gram each and a pill searching after that Empathogenesis.  We had a crying deep chat right at the beginning of the day and I think this put us on a down all day hence why we didn't fully feel the effects, also because I'd been doing too much. 

We were awake for 3 days straight afterwards, hallucinations, no emotions. Now its been 4 days and I'm fuzzy in my vision, slow and clumsy and feel not normal. I feel like I'm behind a layer stuck in my head.

Really scared its going to be long term as I love MD but I can't deal with this for more than a week.
