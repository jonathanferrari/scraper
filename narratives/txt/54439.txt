Well it might have well been either 1776 or the year 3000 when I was introduced to DMT.  I developed a good crowd of psychedlic drug happy 'good people' friends when I was in college.  As it turns out I would 'accidentally' run into drug offers from time to time.  So it turns out that one day I was studying for a relatively useless test(based on subject matter) and a buddy of my roomates stopped over and yelled for me to come out of my studying cave.  Turns out my fellow buddy and his crew had been taking hits of DMT for a brief period now (1-3 days, GOD DAMN BRAVE EXPLORERS!!!)Anyway I trusted this dude and had never free based before, but I LOVE my psychedelics and also my drug culture.

Well DMT is not an everlasting experience like I have read in a few posts.  It is FAST and SUPER INTENSE, but at the same time sooo introspective or more like questioning as all great trips are, I psychologically removed myself and died.  So my buddy rigged me up a sucker and I sucked up all the smoke and more than he could produced from the aluminum.

THE EXPERIENCE (NOT AT ALL EXAGERATED, VERY INSTANTANEOUS)

OK my head turned into a ball and you throw it into outer-space...WAY out there...it is definitly not coming back.  I Say I am going to die.  As I watch my head (which I have thrown into space) travel away I briefly see my friends distorted face (probably 18 inches from me)say that they all said that too.  Well the most remarkable and amazing moment was when my boomerang head toss landed STRAIGHT back into my own head.  Absolutely remarkable but INCREDIBLY (ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING I CANNOT SUGGEST THIS TO ANYONE WITHOUT A TESTED HEAD TO DO) I regained my 'self' as my head came back to me.  I guess? and I went on to perform my studying duties ever so diligently.  In my opinion it was brilliant, but I did not REMOTELY consider taking another hit for at least 2 years, scary and motivating stuff.

Well to summarize:
DMT is beyond intensity as homosapiens know it.
