It was a day like any other, my friends and I were just sitting around and had nothing to do, in an attempt to buy marijuana the dealer had just ran out, but he had acid for sale for 8$ a tab. My whole life I had been curious to try acid, I always wanted to know what it was like to hallicinate.  The other friends thought it was a bad idea, so they left, leaving me and my other good friend who was also interested.  We bought 6 tabs then went back to his house.

8:30pm : my friend and I decide to drop 1 tab, just by placing it on the tongue and letting it disolve for about 10 minutes then swallowing, we repeated this process till the tabs were gone and we each had 3

9:00pm : I dont want to say I was feeling anything yet, but I was definitly feeling different, very relaxed and light headed

9:30pm : something strange was definitly happening now, it felt like my body was a bit floaty and felt oddly like jello

10:00pm : at this point the body jello feeling grew more intense and my friend and I could not stop laughing at everything, just laughing histarically, mild rushes of euphoria.

10:30pm : this is when the first visuals started kicking in with trails on lights, and the feelings of euphoria had grown more intense, and the jello feeling was still present, could not have a normal conversation without losing train of thought

11:00pm :Everything just seemed to make sense, no matter what I talked about, it looped around and came right back plugging itself into the most random outcomes, I couldnt stop smiling, and at this point the hallucinations were really intense, things would bubble when I looked at them, and my friends face would morph around and I would start laughing because of how funny it looked, we decided to take a walk through a local park and everything in my vision was bending and comming at me, and as I walked by things they had huge trails on them, everything looked intense

11:30pm : everything in my vision would now bend sideways and things would drift around, I hallucinated a tree that wasnt there, the night sky looked absolutely amazing, and I could not catagorize how I felt at this point

12:00am : we decided to walk back to his house, noticing that time took forever, as to what seemed like hours had only been 15 minutes, the jello feeling was not as intense, and the visuals sort of dimmed down a bit, but things were still funny and morphing

12:30am : it strangely felt like I was peaking again when I thought I had already peaked because I then got another rush of hallucinations, only this time, I could taste textures in my mouth that werent there, and I could see what I was listening too

2:30am : everything from 12:30 had continued until this point, where things gradually grew less intense, the body high feeling had mellowed down to just a slightly floaty feeling, objects seemed like they were on their own dimensions and different different ways form each other

3:00am : just sitting up late at night watching random things on youtube, everything was still changing colors and peoples faces were morphing around, I felt very relaxed and content at this point, though if I were to try and sleep, it would be impossible

Throughout the night the hallucinations would come and go but slowly and slowly getting less intense, thought process was a bit easier, and eventually at 9am the next day, I had gotten some sleep and slept through the whole day, I awoke sometime the next night, and felt completely fine

I would have to say that LSD defintly blows my mind, and it opened new doors in myself. In the future I wil definitly try it again.

Anyway hope you liked my report

Peace
