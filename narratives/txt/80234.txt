I was nervous about trying mushrooms, but my friend was going to give me some for free, and it was a good deal. We went to an outdoor mall, and ate them in my friends car. They were good with chocolate. A bit odd taste, but not as bad as I was expecting.

I started feeling really happy. Which for me, is a rare thing. It was good. We sat down to eat, and I really wasn't hungry, but I was obsessed over making sure to get a soda. Then, I barely even drank it.

We left the restaurant and sat on a bench, talking about the world, and what if it were like a video game, or what'd it be like to be an ant and other things like that. I really thought about a lot and decided a lot about my life. I got that really deep trip that made me a bit secluded.

I didn't get paranoid at all, I was fine going up and talking to people. Colors were multiplied just as I had read about. I was worried about having a bad trip, but I was prepared about what to do. I knew you weren't supposed to be around people, but it wasn't bad. I actually enjoyed talking to people.

Overall, I didn't want it to end. I was so peaceful, and sure of life. My self-confidence was extremely high.
