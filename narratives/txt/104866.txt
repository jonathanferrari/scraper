Psilocybin and Cluster Headaches

Two years ago I started suffering from cluster headaches and at first, assumed I was suffering from really bad migraines. To ease the pain I would take NSAID's (Aleve, Advil) for acute attacks and eventually was prescribed Sumatriptan. The Sumatriptan was designed for acute attacks yet the patient can only take 7 pills a month to not become tolerant. For me this is not enough. 

I did a small amount of research about Cluster Headaches once I was diagnosed before coming across the experiences of others and their success with psilocybin mushrooms, LSA, LSD, and for acute attacks DMT. I decided to try mushrooms considering I was heading to a music festival soon. I was quite excited to see how the experiment would turn out. 

After arriving to the festival a friend at my campsite had honey, which contained extracted psilocybin from mushroom. The honey has unknown potency. So I volunteered. I ate a tablespoon full of the honey and a nice but very mild trip ensued. 

Since the experience with the psilocybin I have yet to experience a cluster headache. It has been two weeks with no headache bear in mind that I was having cluster headaches daily between clusters. Only time will tell how long the bliss will last.
