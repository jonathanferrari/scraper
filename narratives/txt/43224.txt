I skipped out on class and went with some friends to smoke some weed. We were 4 and we smoked about 6 grams in total.

It was all fun and we were laughing for the first hour or two. Then 2 of my friends went home and me and the other guy went to mall to get something to eat.

After we ate, we went out for a cigarette through the emergency fire escape door. After we finished the cigarettes, he left to go home, I started walking to take the city bus.

I started to feel really heavy, I couldn't even scratch my head because my arm felt so heavy. I started to sweat but at the same time I was feeling really cold, I could barely see anymore, I could only see one thing and the backround was all black. For example, I would look at a car and it would be all I see nothin else. 

I just sat down next to the wall and curled up into a ball and just watched people pass by for about 2 hours.

When I got home I just passed out on the couch.
