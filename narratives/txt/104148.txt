A Mind Expanding Journey

The Trip was different than any thing I had heard before online, so going in I had no way of knowing what I was in for. It was me and my girlfriend in our appartment room, the place we felt safest as has been suggested to us by a friend. We had only taken DMT one time before, at her brothers house and while that trip in the moment seemed to be more intense than I could handle, but it was nothing after feeling my second trip.

We packed a glass bowl with a thin layer of ash an the put the DMT in, mostly a whole rock, as my girlfriend had given up on breaking it up, then put another layer of ash on top of that. As I was mentally preparing to smoke, I breathed in and out slowly three times, then hit it, held for about 12 seconds, the released, I felt a buzz, but hit it again. After I released the second hit my mind fucking exploded. The pipe elongated before me and I almost dropped it, but held on to it. My hands looked almost babyish, and the lighter went from arange to green to blue to orange, and I was tripping. Then I hit it again at the urging of my girlfriend, and lost it. The colors were more intense than I knew they could be, and I was instantly happier than I had ever been, so happy that for the first time I cried tears of joy. I layed back and laughed and screamed pure happyness, and the I got up and looked at my girlfriend, an what I saw was her true self, who she is in the spirit world, and she was beautiful. She has orangish skin, with six eyes running up and down her face. She has a green aura, the first real aura I've seen, and I cry even more. 

Then I blacked out and went to a different place, which unfortunately I could not remember after I came to. Even after I tripped I still could see more colors than before.
