I ordered some 12' cuttings of San Pedro cactus and after many trial and error I found the best method of preparation.

De-spining- The spines are cut off removing as little of the green tissue as possible *Remember the tissue right under the skin is the most potent

Cutting and Freezing- The pieces are cut away from the core and the core is discarded, the cactus is cut into about 1' cubes and those are placed in a freezer for several hours

Grinding and Filtering- The cubes are allowed to thaw and ground in a blender until it turns into a pulp. The pulp is placed in a French Press coffee maker (this is the most essential tool). Push the plunger down slowly and collect the greenish/milky liquid (light should not be able to shine through it)

Repeat until I have as much liquid as possible

DOSING NOTES: 
*3 cups of liquid is a pretty strong dose for me
*If Syrian Rue extract is available I take 1/2 cups with about 3/4 of a teaspoon of syrian rue

I gave some to my friends and was waiting to get in touch with them before I dropped mine. I finally found out they'd started without me and were wandering in the woods. I hopped in my car and tried to meet up with them, while on the way I chugged my two water bottles of cactus juice (3 cups)(4:45pm) NOTE: It tastes vile. It is not that hard to get it down and there is very little nausea. The key is not to throw up. I get a chaser like a soda, and don't go too fast, I don't want to risk throwing up. Let me tell you, it's very much worth it.

I finally arrived at the park (5:50) they told me to go to and waited for about 15 minutes yet it seemed more like an hour. I noticed I was starting to come up as I hadn't eaten all day. The park was full of rich people playing frisbee and I started getting bad vibes from them so I called and said I was gonna leave. It was cool, another one of my friends was looking for em too. Now I had to leave because I was definitely coming up, (6:10) I probably shouldn't have been driving but I was pretty close to home. I started seeing trails coming off most of the cars with vivid colors, nature sounds like birds chirping was pretty much the only thing I could hear.

I got home (6:25) and started listening to music, the blank ceiling and walls started morphing into very intriquite patterns. I went into the bathroom and closed the door so it was dark, WOW I was tripping so hard, the image of my head in the mirror vanished and the whole room was morphing.

NOTE: In this setting I can see my spirit animal which is telling about my personality (I'm a bat). It will appear to me as I'm looking in the mirror. I picked up some weed and smoked a bowl to myself. (9:00peak) I came up really fast. The grass looked like I was looking at a rainforest from above, and the trees around me morphed into all kinds of things: patterns, animals, mayan hyroglyphs. Every leaf on a bush turned into an eye looking at me. It was very very awesome and I wasn't anxious at any time during my trip. I continued to think about things like the universe and our place in it, and I saw patterns for about 3 hours after that.
