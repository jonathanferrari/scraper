I hadn't done mushrooms in a very long time and a friend happened to know someone trustworthy that had some.  So we planned a camping trip, but ended up staying in the back yard. 

After taking 5 or 6 small caps and stems and eating them the effects came on slowly, over the course of 45 minutes.  I first noticed when we were blowing bubbles in the back yard and the colors were becoming blindingly bright, I could see the vibrations of the bubbles as they quivered in the air. Later I looked up at the stars and noticed they were made of 3 colors like a 3d movie, my friends were enjoying something in the house, but I didn't feel light and childish as I had before, instead I walked to the fire pit and sat, staring into the flames.  

I was overcome with sadness and the realization that this was a memory, and that I had seen this same fire, this same flame reflected in a copper fire ring, in another time.  I was watching it through different eyes, but the same because they had once been different windows to my soul. I watched the fire but did not feel comfort from its warmth, the reflection of the heat and light told me a story of when this had been a necessity, when I had been a slave to someone cruel, that I felt hopeless, with no future, no expectation of freedom or change.  I knew I would die, I knew this fire was someone else's fire, that I had seen that reflection in burnished copper in another time, an ancient time.  A time when I had been a woman, and I had been property and not prized property, and the flames and the copper brought up a deep sadness and despair.  I acknowledged this memory, this feeling and I let it go, back to the stars, back to the fire and out of my memory.   

I went to my tent to meditate on this experience; it was deep and difficult, I was happy when the night was over, when it became the day again. Difficult but, so important.
