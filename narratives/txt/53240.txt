Up until the end of October of last year I was what I would describe as an average, if long term ecstasy user. I would take 3 - 5 pills one night  a month usually at home, with the same circle of friends. I had been doing this since (with the exception of a six month period in 1997 after the break up of my marriage when I was taking 5 Â– 10 pills three nights a week) 1993 and had not experienced any of the Loss of Magic that I had heard reported. During this time I had not taken vitamins, Anti-oxidants or anti depressants. The only thing that I did was to make sure the next day I engaged with the world by going out to eat and didn't just crash out.

However, at the start of October I met with my friends as usual and we followed our ritual i.e.  drop 1st pill at about 9.30, wait about half an hour or so until we all notice the first signs of brain re-tuning / sweaty palms / whatever then drop a 2nd one. 
I had my classic symptoms of coming up, and about an hour and a half after taking the first pill, pretty significant floating double vision. My friends were really buzzing and where all smiles and pretty touchy feely. But although my vision was off on its own I felt completely straight, not uncomfortable nor any other negative feeling, just straight. We took another pill at 11.30 and I took my last one at 1.30. By then my visuals had more or less stopped and at 3.00 I was feeling pretty tired and went to bed.  

By the next week I had put it down to just one of those things that happened, maybe I had got lesser quality pills out of the batch that we had been using from the last 6 months or maybe they had become stale. I had a party to go to at the end of the month and was sure that everything would be back to normal by then. 

The party arrived and I had five pills from the original batch for the night. I took my 1st one at home before I got on the train knowing that I would be dropping again as I reached my destination and that I would be flying after the scary cab-ride through unlit country lanes to the stable where the party was. Only, by the time I got there I wasn't having any "pilling" effects. I didn't feel switched on at all. I had no visuals, or grinding, just a slightly sleepy stoned. I double dropped hoping to kick the 1st two in but after a couple of hours I was just tired with a mild headache. I gave my last pill away.

I decided to have the next couple of months away from pilling and give my self a detox. 

I met up with my friends on New Years Eve and took five pills this time at a rate of one an hour. Again I had no sense of thought patterns changing or visuals, just the same sleepy stoned feeling but without the headache.

Last week I took my 1st pill since that time, a few months break. One of the original batch from last year and to my great surprise and relief everything has come back.
