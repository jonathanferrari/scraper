First of all, sorry for my english, I've tried cannabis, LSD, LSA, x-nBomes, Mushrooms and a lot of things.

T 0: it's 9:30 pm and I ate 5 grams of dried mushrooms Nepal Chitwan with a tangerine and a tablet of vitamin c, my stomach is empty and I thought well I'm gonna wait for them to hit while I'm chatting with some of my friends but they hit me really fast.

T+15: Wow I noticed that mushrooms were doing their work and I started to feel a coolest sensation and a little change on my consciousness, I felt connected with everything in my room, so I decided stop chatting and just listen to the music and enjoy the experience.

T+20: Everything in my room started to breathe and the music felt in the air, I went for an apple and a tangerine to eat later, and the nausea started to invading me, so I lay on my bed to avoid thrown out everything, all in my room were waving like a liquid room and the macropsia and micropsia effect were evident

T+40: definitively I'm on a big mushroom trip, the time is passing slowly and I continued climbing up more each second and I laugh like an idiot feeling everything shaking and changing it shapes, when I closed my eyes I saw a lot of fractals, and with open eyes the colors were really brightfull and beautiful, then I started thinking what's next, definitely every second I felt more and more high.

T+1h: I needed to pee so I went to the bathroom but my house looks quite different like if I were in another place, and I've been living in y house my entire life but it was like rediscovered it again, it was really hard to return back to my room because the waving sensation, macropsia, micropsia and my body high, I was like someone really drunk.

T +1h 5m: what? just 5 minutes, I felt like every second was like a minute and I start to feel scared about the trip because all my recurrent thinkings, I wanted to thrown out and stop going up because by that moment the visual effects were so intense and all my senses were really stimulated, I saw fractals even with open eyes, I wrote to my nephew who lives next door to take care of me but he didn't answer (it's no strange haha), because I didn't want to stay alone, but I thought 'hey, it was my own choice' I just need to relax and enjoy the experience because tomorrow I'm gonna laugh about this.

T +1h 15m: A lot of vibrations started to invading my ears like if someone or something were trying to speak with me, then two entities appear in something like an Egyptian spacecraft, their language was in vibrations but I was understanding everything they told me, I start speaking with them for at least 15 minutes I guess they wanted a fusion with me and being a single entity, and then they told me that I could see the universe, I was afraid but I was excited as well, and I don't have anything to lose, so I just let me go.

T+ 1h 30m: the entities went inside me, and it was like if I was speaking with myself and myself, I was three and one person at the same time, and then they took me out of my room, I heard a strong noise in the roof and when I realized all my room was desintegrated and I started to fall to the space, I saw a lot of things and I was thinking a lot of existentialism, I felt really good and bad like if the good things and bad things were always at the same time, I was on my space odyssey for about 2 hours, then I was returning home slowly and finally I was on my bed again and all the things (my house) were build again.

T+3h 30m: I was s confused about the trip but sincerely the strong effects were dissipated, I was thinking a lot of things with a really pace-full mind, I was really happy with everything and everyone, and I heard a voice that told me that I needed to forgive myself, I sat on my bed and started to enjoy the music, because I put a big playlist on my player, I danced with the music and ate the tangerine and the apple, then I was watching tv and laugh about every single thing, the next 2 hours I was really quiet but tired.

T +5h 30m: I started to feeling that mushrooms were ending and I was returning to my normal consciousness state, so I turn off the lights and just lay on my bed thinking about the experience, maybe a half hour later I was sleeping.

Next day I woke up early and felt a little confused but happy, I don't know why but I felt like if I found myself again, I want to take mushrooms again but maybe in a month or two or three or I don't know for sure, but this experience changed my entire life I guess.
