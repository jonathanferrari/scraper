[Reported Dose: "150mg of 93percent thc cannabis wax via a vaporizer"]

So this is being written while I am tripping. Just want to start things off with that. 

I experience what are called 8b, and 8a level geometries at varying times. I see multiple dimensions and experience intense synesthesia. I have spiritual visions intensely as this is being practiced alongside Pagan Chaos Magick. 

I am watching fear and loathing at 10:55 PM at night and I'm 15:52 into the movie. Raoul Duke is checking into the casino.

10:59 PM I am watching the movie. I began to come down a bit from the cannabis.

Reality has taken on a bright vibrant aesthetic that has a cartoonish or graphic novel feel to it.

That is all. I am gonna forget to finish this so thats all I have to report.
