The plan was to try and clear the entire bowl in three big rips. The first time I "toasted" the bowl with the torch lighter, doing my best to try and just melt the DMT and burning the top of the bud as little as possible. Second time I torched the bowl, and the third time I completely torched it to clear out the bowl. I was "good" after the second hit, but knew if I wanted to break through, I had to stick to the plan and force myself to hit it the third and final time. 

Upon the completion of the third hit, I let go of the bong (into my wife's hands), closed my eyes and laid back on the couch. My first closed eye visuals were of dark purple & blue fractals on a black canvas, but they were gone almost immediately, because it was nothing more than a loading screen. 

I no longer knew if I was still breathing, or how to breathe. No fear or panic though, it's as if I forgot that breathing existed. I couldn't feel the couch holding me up, I couldn't feel anything physical, I had left my body. 

All I could see were defined strips and segments, of the most vivid colors, like red and yellow, and that was only the background. In the center of my vision was something, I can't even describe it. It was like a big head, but in the shape of an hourglass, or a 3d infinity symbol, and it was all flowing in on itself. No defined details about it were clear though, it was incredibly complex and moving. 

I was not alone.

I was surrounded by a group of figures, they resembled long shadows on a sidewalk. They were circled around me, like when you cut paper to be a chain of people. No details, no marks, just elongated shadow people. At one point they were all franticly making motions with their arms, trying to grab me and "pull me up", and making the motion to "come here". When the motioning stopped, we were all floating "at the top". We weren't in a physical place, but it felt like the top was enclosed, like a dome, with no sense of anything below.

When I started to come to, and open my eyes, I felt like I couldn't stop smiling, I felt almost delirious with a sense of euphoria. I remembered reading that I needed to just start talking as quickly as possible, because it will fade like a dream. As soon I was able to talk, I blurted out the first thing that that I needed to remember and share, "So many people!!"

I felt those people in my vision, their presence was surrounding me. It was so real that when I first felt/saw them, I opened my eyes for a split second, because I was concerned that I had spilled the bong on myself and everyone was standing directly above me trying to figure out what to do.but there was no one anywhere in sight. "They" were there though, and I don't even know how to describe the feeling, because who needs to explain what it's like to be surrounded by people, to another person? 

Meeting "Them", and feeling their presence will stay with me forever. I have always wondered if people see "beings" when they break through because it's what they want, or expect to see. After this experience though, I have no doubts, this drug will transport one outside of one's body, and deliver one onto someone else's doorstep. 

p.s. "Alex Grey's BardoBeing" Â– This is amazingly similar to what I saw, the striping is almost identical (except I saw red, instead of blue), and it has the undefined head-like-flowing-object in the middle. I do not remember seeing this piece of art previously, but now I need to have a print of it in my home!
