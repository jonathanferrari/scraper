After having smoked pot for a few months (previously I had only used alcohol) I began to get interested in psychoactive mushrooms. So I went to my local smartshop and bought 2*30 grams fresh Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms ('Mexican' strain) for me and my best friend. This was going to be our second mushroom experience. The first one was very mild (15g p.p.), and more of a test.

T +0:00 We ate the mushrooms with a large glass of water. They taste like wet cardboard.

T +0:25 First effects. We can't stop laughing. I begin to feel buzzed, the buzz is smoother and better than weed.

T +1:00 I'm beginning to peak. There are constant visual distortions, mostly things rippling and breathing. I feel very warm, soft and euphoric.

T +1:30 I lay down on my bed and close my eyes. I see all sorts of images of plants and geometry.

T +2:00 Being outside is beautiful. It is cold outside but it doesn't really bother me. When I look up at the sky the stars are moving and pulsating.

T +3:45 I've finished peaking. The comedown is very pleasant. I feel very comfortable on the couch, it appears to be soft and made of fur (it's a leather couch).

T +5:45 The effects have mostly worn off. Lying in bed and dozing off is very pleasant.


Well, I'm definitely going to try mushrooms again, all in all it seems to be a very friendly drug.
