In the summer of 1991, a friend of mine and I smoked a large mushroom cap and experienced a psychoactive effect. The setting was early afternoon on a normal pleasant day. I was visiting him, and he had a dried mushroom cap, weighing approximatly 6 to 8 grams, that he had been saving for a long time and he suggested that we try smoking it.

We put it into a water filled bong, and smoked it. The smoke was somewhat harsh, but not unbearable. After approximatly 5 minutes, we both experienced a high form the mushrooms, which was unlike either smoking marijuana, or eating mushrooms. The high was a somewhat giddy feeling, and enhanced color perception, but no hallucinations. We both felt a sensation which we described as 'being in Jello.' It felt as though everything that we came in contact with, including the air around us had a gelatinous continuity with everything else, including our bodies. We felt rather at ease, and were more curious about things around us than normal. The experience was not tremendously mind altering.

The high lasted for about a half of an hour, and then dissipated quickly. Afterwards, we both had a slight peaceful, satisfying feeling for the rest of the day; although we were no longer feeling the high.

This is much different than the experiences I have had while eating mushrooms, or with any other kind of substance.
