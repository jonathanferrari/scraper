First Time Dropping MDMA

I recently decided to try MDMA for the first time. It was a great experience when it was occurring, but I had/am having a long 'hangover.' It was my first time doing it, and I only dropped once that night. From what I understand, it was pure MDMA.

The night of, the effects were amazing. They hit me 45 minutes after dropping and lasted 3.5 hours. After the positive effects wore off, I went home, and left my friends because I was too tired.

I was just drained for the whole entire day after. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I was generally depressed. I was:
-Lazy
-Tired
-Upset about everything
-Unable to do math (had a math assignment)... so unable to process complex thoughts
-My head ached

It helped a lot when I ended up going to a friends house (the 3 people who I dropped with). We all hung out and watched movies and played video games, which really helped my depressed state, but it was a long day.

Throughout the rest of the week, the 'hangover' began to wear off, until only two side effects remained on day 4. I was lazy, and wasn't able to do work. I am usually a very hard worker, and driven individual. I usually hit up the library for 6 hours at a time. But I was unable to study at all. I would open a book and start reading, but would not process anything. 

It is now day 6 of the 'hangover' and it is continuously getting better. Hopefully it all goes away!
