First time LSD trip for a constant shroomer

On a clear night, I went to someone's house I didn't know that well with a new good friend of mine from treatment. I have gobbled tons of boomers in my lifetime but I had never experienced acid.

I felt like I knew what to expect: maybe to get a little uneasy  because it would be very intense. But this was not so.
Yes, it was more intense. Things seemed to move much faster than on shrooms. I ended up having sex on acid. This was something that was not planned! I saw stars, tons of them, beautiful stars,slightly deformed stars--- and the scenery was always immaculate. I studied everything, because there was so much demention, and it didn't have any similar hallucinations to shrooms. This was an individualized drug, I must say. Completely unexpected. I remember looking at a Kurt Cobain poster. Kurt was winking, smiling and even slightly flirting with me through his stares.I laughed at lot, this drug is so beautiful, I seemed to be seeing chinese dragons in trees and such, it was SO beautiful. Everything was.

The next 2 days I felt a little dead/emotionless but it all comes back.
