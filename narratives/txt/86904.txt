I ingested two and a half frozen ice cube-sized molds of high-cacao content chocolate into which I mixed powdered mushrooms. The method I leave undescribed as it is thoroughly explained on various websites. 

The amount I ate was approximately 3.4 g, give or take 0.1 g, of Psilocybe cubensis 'Ecuador' mushrooms, seven years old, kept powdered in the freezer. I have repeatedly eaten old powdered mushrooms and their intensity keeps well for many years, as long as it is in an airtight seal, away from light and frozen.

The flavor was absolutely delicious, with none of that pretty disgusting mushroom aftertaste. The only thing about mushies I don't like. I started at 11:23 PM, and finished the last piece of choco-mush at 11:53 PM. At about 6:00 AM I was basically back to normal, although with strong lassitude that lasted the entire day.

The trip was so intense that I cannot adequately ascribe it to such a relatively low dose as this. Therefore and lacking any other choco-trips under my belt, I would have to agree with others who have said that there is indeed something in good quality chocolate which intensifies tryptamines, at least psilocin.

Now to the experience itself. My God, I am still amazed at what I felt and saw. The title I gave to this report is because I had a definite sense of an astonishing flexibility of physical space, a twisting or warping which I sensed with eyes closed. I will get back to this later. 

But it is the emotional content that was paramount for me. Parenthetically I have to explain that I had been off mushrooms for a long time before I started again just a few weeks ago. Circumstances just didn't lend themselves to experimentation, or maybe I was just making excuses. Now, with this trip, I got back to mental places that I had not visited in many years. What joy! The first flash of this was somewhere atround the middle of the trip. I realized suddenly that I just felt something (and saw something!) that I had in a long ago trip, an exact mental state and the accompanying imagery. I was dumbfounded. I didn't know that this was possible. It happened again just a few minutes later, a different state and image. I can't explain here the characteristics of what I saw, but I can assure you that a definite sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu was present. 

Later, I was amazed, as I saw floating past me, a fractal entity. It was symmetrical about the horizontal axis. I have researched a bit what kind of fractal it looked like, and the closest I can come up with is some undescribed variation on the Mandelbrot set, but just a portion, a symmetrical duplication along the x-axis of a fat yet pointy nose-like structure, filled with the very florid and colorful detail characteristic of the Mandelbrot.  But this was absolutely a living fractal, made up of living matter. Was it protoplasm? Some kind of flesh, or a metaphysical living material? I was somehow made to think I had to pay reverence to it as it went by, as though it were some kind of deity.

At another moment, I could hardly believe it. I relived a fragment of a dream, from long, long ago. It was definitely from that dream, something about a man on a street and a lamppost that was falling across the street, toward the man but without harming him. As I said, just a fragment. But this lends weight to a theory I have been thinking of, that the tryptamine trance in general and psilocybin's in particular, is a voyage to the world of dreams. This is not as farfetched as it sounds; after all, our dreaming mind is the link to another reality. Call it what you will, transcendental reality, the immanent domain, life after death, the nature of ultimate reality, hyperspace, the unseen dimensions that are the true reality and not this one. What it comes to is that we have built-in the capacity to transcend the physical domain, and that is through our dreaming state. The mushrooms facilitate this. 

I saw something else later that I equated with the dreaming dimension, that the mushroom trip is a visit to the people of ----------; and unfortunately I do not remember the word that appeared to me then. I saw some human beings that belonged to this realm.

Later, I was strongly aware of the sound of crickets coming from my open window. I listened intently, enjoying it. Slowly, the sounds they made turned into imagery. The cricket chirping was transformed into little critters. In a high domed structure which I tentatively equated with my cranium or my brain, someone, one of the tryptamine denizens, was playfully chasing the little chirps-turned-into-critters; it was a game, and it/he and they seemed to enjoy it immensely. I felt a sense of wonderment. I was grateful beyond words. To think that the mushroom would show me such things. I felt childlike, filled with an immense innocence. This was a grace, as I did not feel I deserved it, I did not feel worthy.

But from then on I laughed gently, teeheeing even. Yes, a grown man teeheeing! 

I had to get up several times to urinate, as is usual when taking mushrooms. It was a tremendous effort, as I was very unsteady on my feet, totally uncoordinated. As I came back to bed each time, and I closed my eyes, I saw many images. All seemed to be fired off by (or coinciding with) a mental sound or word, or should I say a vocalization. It was someone saying these pseudowords. Nonsense words, meaning nothing in our everyday language. Childish enunciations that I have experienced almost since the first time I ate psilocybin mushrooms. But I wonder if maybe they might have some meaning nonetheless. Terence McKenna was big on language during the psilocybin trance. I say someone was vocalizing, but I wasn't the one. Who?

Now, toward the fourth hour after ingesting the mushie-laced chockies, and as I purposely stayed raised on an arm in bed with eyes open, I felt a very different condition. I was very much in a strong trance, thinking being somewhat difficult; you might say I was stoned, but I reserve that word for other drugs that make you feel stupid and lethargic. I felt a powerful tightness in my face and head, as if all the muscles were tensed and rigid. It was then that a realization came to me, that this was the culmination. This state felt special; I can only come up with the thought that this was a mental state in which anything was possible. I believed that reversibility thinking was not only possible then, but easy. Those familiar with the writings of Joseph Chilton Pearce will know what I mean. I felt that this was the mushroom's crowning grace to humans. This state of mind.

I then came upon the phenomenon that relates to the title of this report. As I closed my eyes, there in front of my face, in an area I've come to call my event stage, or ampitheater, there happened some amazing things to the structure of space. I saw it (not as clearly as I would have hoped) bending, twisting, twirling, revolving back unto itself. I opened my eyes, then closed them again, and it happened again! I don't know how many times. Those of you who've done Salvia divinorum will recognize this as almost a signature phenomenon of it, this twisting of space. I have proven, at least to myself, that this also belongs to the tryptamine dimension.

Wow, all this and right in my own little magic theatre! The price of admission: my mind. 

With this paraphrase of Hermann Hesse I close this narration. I have seldom had such a magical time before. The entire experience felt pointed, diamond-like in its intensity. 

I don't know to what to attribute it. All I know is that I believe that eating mushrooms mixed into chocolate will now be a favorite of mine, maybe even the only way I'll do it. 

I can't say enough for it, and I can't say enough for the venerable psilocybin mushroom.
