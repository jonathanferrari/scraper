Thizz Report

5:00 injested vitamin smoothies and took a two hour nap to prepare for an intense experience...

7:25 injested one stack but so small could have been half-stack 'purple keys' 1 each person. 160 lbs 5 10' 135 lbs 5 9' 

8:48 We smoked some strong medical cannibus to bring on the roll. Feeling a good indica cannibus stone but do not feel the classic "extacy" feeling expected. We ate before ingesting pills and wonder if this fucked it up. Still have some hope it will kick in. This 10 dollars is not going to waste.

9:45 Starts kickin in nicely.

10:59 The high is very strong and mellow. These are very good pills and definetly contain a lot of mdma for their small size. Opiate like very nice happy euphoria can be distinctly felt by both of us.

11:07 We loved these pills. Any more than one would be ridiculous. We have gained a certain respect for the chemical from this experience. Eating before definetly delayed the come-on but after about 2 hours it became the roll we wanted. 

11:14 Grinding of the teeth noticed and the lockjaw is not too enjoyable. A piece of gum does the trick.

11:39 Very fun ride would definetly want to do this again. Have not completely came down but am starting to drift back to the real world.
