A Trip of the Mushroom Spirits

I am a 17 year old male.  I have a wide history with opiates and psychedelics. Last summer was one of many mushroom trips as my friends would collect many pounds of them and rely on me to sell them.  One day towards the end of summer I sold my old scale to my friends for 4 grams of closed cap yellow cubensis.  I thanked my friends and started walking down the street munching on them. 

After walking the 15 min. Walk downtown I decided to go up to my mates cottage.  It took another 10 min. Bus ride to get there, at which time I was starting to feel the emotional buildup that I usually get right before a hard fry from mushrooms and slight visuals.

My mate greeted me exuberantly, slightly disapointed that I was frying (he cannot fry on mushrooms for some unknown reason). We went to the smoking room and blazed up a decent sized bowl of california kush, which was in season at the time. After about 5 min after smoking the bowl I started to really feel the effects of the mushrooms. Intense visuals and a sinking feeling that made me almost fall over on the way to the bathroom. 

After about an hour after I initially ate the mushrooms my mate and I went out for a smoke, after smoking about 5 or 6 cigs we went back inside.  I was sitting on his couch for what seemed like a lifetime, but it must've been only 5 min. I noticed that I cut myself removing a filter on a smoke.  Looking quite intensly at it the blood started swirling and curling  back inside my body  at which point was almost too much on an emotional level to understand at that point in my trip.

After freaking out for a couple min. I started to settle down and gained slightly more control as one can on shrooms.  

All in all I dont think its worth it to fry on magic mushrooms without a friend frying with me.
