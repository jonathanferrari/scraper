##EROWID_NOTE:LACED_CANNABIS##

One day me and my friend C were going to smoke some weed like we did every so often. I had bought a dime the day before.

Smoking it came with an unusual set of effects. Shortly after we had smoked it we were both seeing little slivers or crystals in our vision. It looked like everything we saw was broken down into little slivers. Also our hearing was incredibly strong.

We think it might have been laced, but it is probably just really strong stuff. I know from experience that there are all different kinds of weed, but this was something else.
