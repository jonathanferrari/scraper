I have done many drugs including DMT several times.  For the past few months I have been experementing with DMT quite often.  It wasnt until last weekend that I actually had something completly unique to write about.  I started off by having a couple glasses of whiskey to ease my nerves.  I started smoking it and smoked about every half hour.  The first few times were normal (if anything about a  DMT trip can be considered normal).  Then probably about my 4th time.  I took about 4 big tokes.  My world was transformed in to a completly gold plated universe.  As I look at things a was able to look into them and see how exactly they work.  Everything was colorful and amazing.  Thats when it shifted for strong visuals to strong emotions.  I felt as if there was an alien presence looking over my every move.  It was as if they have been here all along and I finally noticed them.  Then a dramatic change in my reality, I dont exactly remember what happened.  But it was as if the alien presence was a divine force and it seemed that they may have told me somethin that explained the reality infront of my eyes.  Almost as if they helped me to solve the mathmatical proof of human existance.  I was completly and uterly speachless from what had just happened.  In fact I didnt even think about it for about 3 days because it was almost too much for my mind to handle.  Now that I think back, I can blame it on the DMT.  But it still feels like somthing showed me the meaning of life and it was too much for my mind to handle so it shut down and blocked it out.  You have to be carefull with this drug.  I have realized it was just and insane DMT trip but  it could have been takin it for a spiritual experience.    I had to realize it is just chemical reactions inside of my brain otherwise I could fall victim to an unbelievable lie.
