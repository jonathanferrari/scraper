My now fiance, at the time my new girlfriend, had invited me to her dad's for the weekend, because he and his wife (my fiance's stepmom) were on vacation.  We woke at about 11am, and my fiance, I'll call her LA, wanted to take a shower before we started smoking.  By the time she was done in the shower, maybe 15 minutes after we agreed to this little wake and bake session, I was in her living room, stoned to bejesus.  This was the first time that I had ever experienced any psycho-active symptoms from smoking pot.  Everything was of course coated in hillarity, and when she got back from the shower, I was in wide-eyed disbelief about how high I was.  She laughed and took the bong from me, finishing up the last little bit and having her own load.

I then tried to explain what my head was feeling like.  When sober, we view our world from our eyes, and this is where our perception of ourselves comes from-the front of the face.  I felt like my concept of 'me' was not my immediate body or eyes.  I felt like I was watching a movie of the living room, and my eyes were the camera, only I was watching this movie playing out from 3 feet behind my head.  The movie 'Being John Malkovich' is similar to what I experienced.  In 'BJM,' people's consciousnesses are thrown into John's head, and they watch through his eyes, but from behind them, with no apparent control over their new body.

Throughout this weird trip, I was never scared, or aprehensive, or panicky at all.  I was just amazed at the weirdness of it all.  I had displaced my self-realizing or self-perception a few feet behind me.  Thank god her 100# great dane was still locked up, because I don't think I could have handled the great puppy beast in such a stupified state.
