Short DMT Insights

Joining a friend for a light after dinner snack, I once again lit up some [30-40mg] DMT and relaxed back. 

I took no notice of the sound or my body, but was this time transfixed by the colours. I once again saw my stereotypical figures, potentially because I did not really want to see them again, not being the greatest fan of nightclubs. 

This time it felt like the majority of them were female, and considerably closer. They all swayed left to right and moved towards me, and it felt like their hands were moving over my face, as a strange fish-eye lens effect embraced me. Their faces this time round were considerably more grotesque, and I tried hard to direct myself away, which I did successfully and was granted with a vision of a beautiful rainforest, littered with gems and crystaline butterflies. I enjoyed this vision immensely, I was convinced that I felt the light over me from the moon above, but it quickly disappeared. 

This experience felt like the shortest one I had, and once again I can't stress to enjoy DMT only when you feel the urge. In particular I will keep this approach for when I increase my dosage and get deeper into its mysteries.
