It rubs your face in it. It really does, the experience is only just fading and I'm totally unsure what to make of it, was it good? was it bad? I'm sure to find out in the coming months....

So anyway, I have been severely depressed for as long as I can remember now... I have tried various antidepressants/counseling etc and to me, its all bullshit.

So that's when I decided to start looking into psychedelics as a way of 'seeing into my problems' and WOW that's what I got. 

I apologize for the lack of depth and detail in this report, I just wanted to convey that mushrooms just took many of the problems in my life, that I have been avoiding thinking about, shielding myself from maybe. It took these issues and has just spent the last 4 hours rubbing them in my face, made sure I got a real close look at them.

It remains to be seen whether this was a good thing or not, I'm hoping that it is!
