I begin to lose contact
From my so familiar scene
Objects begin to become real
'Could this be only a dream?'

Clouds are moving around me
Familiar faces are peeking
But in the void lies the noble truth
In which we are seeking.

But once more I ask myself, 
'Could this be only a dream?'

There was no warning
No call considered fair
I must magnify my vision
And remove myself from care.

And in these moments
So amazingly beautiful
We are at peace with the Universe
Ambitious and in control.

But once more I ask myself,
'Could this be only a dream?'

As the void is obtained
and the noble truth in hand
I shed a tear in fear
This won't happen again.
But I am very certain
There's a journey see
But once more I ask myself,
'Could this be only a dream?'
