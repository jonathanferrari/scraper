When I take blue stars it always kicks in around exactly 40 minutes. I took it at 2:20 PM and it kicked in right around 3:00 PM.

I felt very energetic and horny. I took a 5 minute, extremely fast and energetic power walk to my friend's house. I had a strong urge to hug her and tell her how pretty she is. I layed on her couch and experienced intense vertigo. 

At 4:20 PM I took my second pill before I left my house to catch the subway from Brooklyn to Nyc. At around 5:00 PM on the train the second pill kicked in. I experienced EXTREME nystagmus and trisma . I saw two of everything. I couldn't bring my self to move. 

Around 6:00 PM I got off the train, this time I was walking VERY slow. I was not energetic but extremely sluggish. I walk to the store in the subway and got a straw and started chewing it right away. I was walking down 31st street at an incredibly slow pace, staring straight ahead seeing doubles while listening to comfortably numb. I had traffic piling up behind me. It took me 25 minutes to walk 2 city blocks. I was chewing this straw like an animal. People were staring at me as they went around me due to my abnormally slow pace. By around 7 I was coming down. I wasn't tripping, but I wasn't sober. The next day I felt great, happy, no soreness, no nausea, no headaches.
