Setting: ULTRA festival 2002 in downtown Miami with three of my friends (a techno/DJ music festival)
Mood: A little depressed, alienated from the people around me. I think to myself I guess this MDMA pill should set things alright, thats what there for!

I take the pill as the sun is setting. An hour later I had the worst experience of my life. Pacing around the concert hall trying to fight my body from having a seizure or a heart attack. Never have I felt this physically sick. It was absolute psychosis...So I ditch the place and end up walking around downtown Miami for 3 hours until this crap wears off.

I did not realize love or empathy like MDMA has done to me in the past. I realized the pain and suffering of the world we live in every day. Overall a very depressing and psychotic experiece. I will never do X again.
