The yellow wooden walls suddenly had transparent blue Aztec... Amazonian... Polynesian geometric patterns... Except... They were curvy. Then these patterns shifted into what looked like TREE BARK CARVINGS of people... Or faces... And both of my friends' faces had people forming... Little people, camouflaged on my friends' faces. 

When the trip starts, I felt like I was sinking slowly and deeply into myself, my body, my very core. But also felt pulled outwards and sprung back like I was made of rubber... Sitting down in the chair and breathing, I felt so relaxed... I felt like I was imagining myself on a tropical vacation, but amongst a warrior tribe. I could faintly imagine myself imagining tribal music being played. On one of the walls, there was a hole, and some wood disfigured in it... It looked like an owl in its tree hole or nest. 

When I went outside during my coming-down, I felt so blessed to be alive. I felt joy looking at the colours of the sunset sky, and all of the greenery nearby. After my trip was over, I felt renewed. I felt like myself again, but the "self" I was in the afterlife before I was born. My soul was rejuvenated, perhaps.
