One night I was at a friends house, and we had just got back from my sisters high school graduation. We all (5 people) went to my friends room, and lit up some great Boone (north carolina) Nug bud. It taste so good I could have died. I could feel it kick in as I took the first hit. We all sat and talked and laughed, but then Thomas took out a rolling paper. Oh, shit I was already in over my head. I didn't think I could handle any more, but it was just the kind of bud I couldn't pass up. Do you know what I mean?

Thomas started rolling it and showed us how to roll a ' mully' joint. It was so fucking funny. He was acting like it was an infomercial. We where all tripping out, he is so funny. Then we smoked another one and talked and laughed. But here is were the good part starts. Every one left the room , but I stayed in the room. The reason for this is I usually trip unusually to much. So, I stayed and tripped.

The first part was me sitting down in an air bubble chair. I was thinking of me just sitting on air, and that must have affected my trip coming up. Here it goes. I was just sitting there thinking of things, and all of a sudden I was blocked in by bricks. Not regular bricks but air bubble bricks (the only way to explain it). The bricks were like the bubble chair I was sitting in. I could not possibly move, the bricks were holding me tight. I closed my Eyes thinking I could lose the trip, but as soon as I did I got sucked into a portal. A portal of infinite knowledge (as always as I trip). I drift and drift. It was telling a story, and a great one at that. Life is great, you have to hold on to the moments and create new ones. I was literally taking deep refreshing breaths just to savour the moment. I can't remember every moment of this experience so I won't ramble. Every time I trip it is spiritual and I learn more and more about the actual world that surrounds us all.
