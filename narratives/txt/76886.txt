Pedro

I wanted to experience San Pedro for a few years, so I acquired a 12" cutting.  I lightly boiled a blended cactus mush and water for abt. 2 hrs., adding water as needed. Anon. strained and gently boiled it down over another 1-2 hrs, yielding a nearly full 8oz. glass and let it refrigerate overnight. Next afternoon it was consumed over a 1 hr period.

2:30-Begins drinking in moderate sized gulps. Resists urge to purge.

3:30-Brew mostly finished. No perceptible effects yet.

4:00-First alerts. Restless stimulation growing, some mild but mounting euphoria. Energy soon starts to blend with simultaneous sedation...relaxation. Feels 'soft' and cozy.

5:00-Eceptional euphoria soon evolves...very pleasant both emotionally and physically. Happy high.

6:00-By now the pronounced psychedelic effects kicked in. subtle green, blue and reddish auras....auditory distortions.

6p.m.-2 or 3a.m.-Warm, fuzzy, thoroughly enjoyable trip ensues at plateau slightly below peak until early morning hrs., then slowly descends until almost 8a.m.

CONCLUSION: Dose was modest, not esp. a psychedelic dose. Exp. however was great. Hangover included moderate headache, but I did not get any sleep. Worked following day. Will soon try larger dose and/or T. peruvianus.
