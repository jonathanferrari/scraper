Ketamine - significant experience

I can write pages regarding the use of intramuscular ketamine use.  I have used ketamine since 1997.  I can't accurately tell how many times I've used it but it numbers in the hundreds.  I have easy access to the pharmaceutical type.  I have only used it Intramuscularly.  This is easy, virtually painless, and relatively consistent.  Street drugs that call themselves something are likely a mixture of various drugs.  Ketamine disassociates me and can lead to accidents and potential death.  I have had one bad trip that led me to punch through a glass window cutting my knuckle open.  On the other hand, ketamine is a relatively safe drug in terms of its pharmacodymanics.  I use low doses to induce the 'ketamine experience'.  After years of recreational use, I now use a low IM dose of approximately 40-60mg in order to avoid the trip or 'k-hole'.  This drug is NOT consistent however and the same dose can illicit different reactions depending on a host of factors.  In my case, 80-100mg will put me into the 'k-hole'.  I have just heard this term 'k-hole' and I feel it is appropriate.  I am no longer interested in experiencing 'severe' trips because it can be scary at times and foremost dangerous.  I cannot always control myself.  Initially, and likely always, I try to use this drug in a safe environment.    I use the lower dose of ketamine to make me 'high' while usually maintaining my sense of orientation.  I use ketamine in low doses to enhance my sexual experiences.  Ketamine in low doses gives me extreme energy and longevity.  I think it can be analagous to 'tantric sex'.  I do many times 'stack' the drug .  In other words, I will inject another 40mg or so as I feel needed.  The trips with higher doses are extremely variable.  I have had many 'all knowing' powerful experiences and I have had some terrifiying experiences where I just want to 'go home'.  I will submit this information at this time and I may submit more in the future.
