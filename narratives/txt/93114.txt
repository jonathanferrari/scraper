MDMA MISS MOLLY

So, I'm on MDMA(molly) right now.
It's a gorgeous drug. I love all my friends around me, and I'm 100% comfortable, even with the people I just met.
I feel in love with everyone. Its wonderful.

I paired this with marijuana, it makes it a chiller roll, where I feel calm but awake, happy, sociable, and like theres not anything wrong in the world. I also am pairing with tobacco. Cigarettes are a must since I smoke already. I'm also smoking hookah which is a great social activity if you have a group. I might be pairing with Ketamine tonight as well. Overall, molly is an amazing trip. It's definitely on the top of my favorite list, and I will continue to use from time to time.

KEY POINTS FOR ME:
DRINK H2O
LISTEN TO YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC
BEING AROUND FRIENDS
BEING PREPARED TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT
