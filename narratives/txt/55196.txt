This was the second time I have done shrooms. I took 2.5g at 11pm, with pretzel rods, while neither full nor hungry. The pretzel rods eliminate all saliva and thus all taste so I didn't taste anything! They kicked in around 12 or so (it took 15 minutes less for my two friends). Once I had 'come up' I noticed that the bottles on the table in front of me seemed to be breathing.

The stucco hotel cieling (that pointy splattered stuff) glowed and undulated. The blanket I was on seemed as if it was a liquid, metallic, yet furry all at once. The best visual was by far the wood floor. The wood grain appeared to be a pattern airbrushed onto a clear plastic floor. Underneath, the wood color looked like an endless waterfall falling away from the seemingly clear plasitc floor. These type of visuals persisted until about 4am (4hour trip). I couldn't sleep for the life of me, so I went outside and chilled. I was smoking pot all the while (I couln't feel the high over the shrooms).

Toward the end of the trip, my friends and I had a very deep conversation about how we felt emotionally better, almost a religious enlightenment of sorts. I am not at all religious, but the feeling could only be described as a positive emotional uplifting. Now 48 hours later, I still feel fine, and have been in an unstoppably good mood. I wouldn,t do this too often, but the whole experience is worth it every so often.
