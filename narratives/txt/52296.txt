Magic Mushrooms Are the Shit

I was 14 the first time I ever experienced shrooms and it turned out to be the best time of my life.

It all started at about 5:00 my boyfriend and I went out and bought a huge bag of shrooms I dont really remember the amount but I know we spent around 100 bucks on it still remember the taste and once I started eating them I didnt stop it took about an hour to kick in and when it did everything changed.

We all stepped outside and sat down to smoke a bowl sundally I stood up and felt myself on top of the world everything started looking different and then my boyfriend said the words that my whole trip revolved around  'once your on shrooms your classified as mentaly insane' for some reason this ment the world to me I liked the fact that I was now classified as insane my friends little brother starts moving his hand back in forth in front of my face and even though I new his hand was only a couple of inches from my face it looked as though it was all the way across the room.  I remeber procrastinating was my biggest problem my shoes were untied and it took me about an hour to finally tie them I held in my piss for a couple hours untill my friends finally convinced me I had to go to the bathroom some time.

My friend rolls over and rolls a blunt so me and 5 of my other friends go around back and climb up into a tree fort the blunt hit so perfectly and I could take the biggest hits with no pain that was also the first time I ever gave a shotgun off a blunt (I had always been more of a bowl/bong person)rember making the guy choke and the feeling of accomplishment I had finally after the blunt we all climed down from the tree and I got on the tire swing all the people I was with were big dudes in the 20's so they all start pushing me I remember feeling as if I was flying the stars looked so close and bright it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  When I got off the tire swing we all just stood their and stared at the stars sundally I closed my eyes and tripped I couldn't see anything except for the colors and shapes in my mind I remember thinking my eyes were open and for some reasomn I just couldent see anything everyone helped me up and I layed my head down my mind became filled with the sights of purple and orange snakes and sundally I opend my eyes still trippin failry hard we all stumbled back inside we layed on the couch and talked about life and how things looked I felt the closest bond with everyone the halucinations were amazing things constantly moving and jumping out at me it wasent at all what I expected.

Shrooms have changed the way I see things my trip was very hard and lasted 4 to 5 hours the come down was slow and enjoyable.
