Nothing..on acid

My friends Chris and Alex were over at a good friend of theirs' house one friday night, and I had to work. I was planning on going over there and dropping acid for the first time after work, but things didn't work out well. I ended up over at Chris' apartment the following Wednesday, and I dropped my two hits then.

My history with psychedelics is as follows: I have eaten chocolates on several occasions, I frequently eat DXM, I have tried morning glory seeds, and of course I smoke herb on a daily basis.

Anyway, I popped the two hits in my mouth at around 7:30 and sucked on them for a good 5 minutes, making sure that they were soaked into my tongue, and then swallowed them. I jammed with Chris for a while, not really paying attention to anything. About an hour later, I realized that I was not experiencing any effects. Alex suggested that my onset was just slower than most people's. I didn't want to believe it, but I did and went outside to smoke a cigarette. At 9:45 I was beginning to think that Alex had fucked me over with fake acid, but I watched him cut my hits from the same blotter him and C had done the previous Friday. I kept waiting for any psychedelic effects, but they never came and I finally went to sleep around 4:30.

Let me also say that I have eaten chocolates before to extremely minor, if any, effects. Meanwhile, Chris always trips out of his mind when he eats those.

I don't understand why I could eat these psychedelics and not feel a damn thing?
