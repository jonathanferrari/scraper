I've tried smoking K before but only on top of a bowl of weed. Having been sober all day I decided to try smoking it by itself. I smoked it by placing a small bump around 25mg on a piece of aluminum foil which was then attached to a toilet paper tube. I heated the bottom of the foil and was quickly bombarded with smoke. I took about 4 good lung fulls of smoke before the tiny pile of powder was gone (I may have spilled it or smoked it all, the effects hit me pretty quick so I'm not sure exactly what happened).

Something I've noticed about smoking K is that it numbs the mouth and lips. I would compare the effects to about 2 snorted bumps of the same size. The peak couldn't have lasted 2 minutes, and the after effects lasted about 10-15 minutes. All in all, even though the effects were stronger, the amount of time it lasts makes it a waste of K.
