On night a couple of my friends and I were hanging out with no weed to smoke. So someone had some parts of a dried pieces of a mushroom cap. So we were wondering if it would do anything to us if we smoked it, because there wasn't enough of it to eat amongst 3 people. So we packed it in a pipe and smoked it. I have to say it was a waste of a mushroom cap.
