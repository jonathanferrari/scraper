This is an account of my first experience with ecstasy.  The pill was known as a pink diamond, as I held it in its cellophane wrapper I could not contain myself.  I wanted to take it so badly, but I had to wait; I am a strong believer in not driving while under the influence of anything.

Around 11:30 pm I injested the tablet at what is called a 'roll' party, where everyone present is under the influence of MDMA.  Twenty minutes later I felt it starting.  At first it was a gentle numbness in my legs and it slowly crept up my body.

At 12:15 am I was at my peak, where I stayed for almost four hours.  It was so wonderful, I had not expected it to be that great.  Everyone I had ever spoken to on the topic said that it was the greatest thing, but I had no idea it would be that good.  I was so aware of everything that was going on.  The techno music sent me into a frenzy, everything was perfect.  I feel lucky that the first time I used ecstasy was with others that were on the drug, it was like everyone was contributing to the good of the group. We were doing things like blowing each other up, giving roller coaster rides (my favorite) and passing each other out after a huge shotgun from the Vick's inhaler. Being touched sent waves of pleasure through my body. I was so in tune with my surroundings and everyone else there.  I did not have a bad thought the entire night.

The next day at approximately 1:00 pm when I awoke, I could still somewhat feel it in my arms and legs.  I was in such a terrific mood for the next three or four days.  The entire experience has turned me on to the the drug and off from many others.  It provided the feeling that I wanted; something that the other drugs I have tried paled in comparison to.  The prescription drug, Celexa, apparently has no ill effects on the drug, which I am on for depression.
