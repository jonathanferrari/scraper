My secret is that I don't particularly like cannabis. Part of that is disdain for the puerile pot culture, but mostly it's just that I have a very high natural tolerance to THC. When I used it previously, the effect was mild-to-nonexistent, and what I did feel was more confusing than pleasant. Nevertheless, I have had some interest in oral THC, widely reputed to have psychedelic-like effects. I just wasn't curious enough to actually try to find any cannabis and test it out.

Then, suddenly, a big bag of weed landed in my lap. One of my new coworkers was experimenting with cannabis cultivation and accidentally grew a huge plant and offered me some of the harvest. Of course I said yes. The timing was actually perfect - the personal problems I mentioned in some of my other trip reports never quite went away, and I found myself in need of a good trip to gain some perspective.

The smoke from the blunt was harsh and it had very little effect by itself. Smoking a bit with a few beers created an effect that was subjectively different and better than the alcohol alone.

-Edibles: I used Oreos to make very crude edibles - three of them, which I ate at 90-minute intervals. This confirmed two things: THC does indeed have psychedelic-like effects, and those effects at the high end are terrifying. There was a brief period in which I felt as if time had stopped and I wanted very badly for it to start moving again.

-Tea: THC is not known to be water-soluble but some other cannabinoids are, so I tried mixing a tiny amount (
