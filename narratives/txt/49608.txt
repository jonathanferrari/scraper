On LSD.

I was out with my friends when all of the sudden we decided to try somthing new. I had never done LSD at the time and I heard it was a lot of fun, so we gave it a go. We went down town to our regular dealer (weed-man), to see if he could help us in our search for acid. Sure enough, HE HAD SOME. We were so excited to finaly try some that we didn't even think about how much that we were supposed to take, we just took 2 hits a piece.

About 30 mins. later, I was sitting next to my dead grand mother, listening to trance music and singing, all at the same time. It was intense! Later that evening while we were still on a trip, we decided to play with a 'wege-board,' now, this was probably not smart... It really messed with my mind. I started seeing little demons running around my house and satanic voices in my head. They were saying 'kill your self, do it come with us...' I got down into the fetal position and began to think of other things, I put my head-phones on and in trying to find a good song on my ipod, I stubled accross 'The Turtles - So Happy Together,' it was like the 60's all over again. I saw flowers and trees, it was great. After the wonderful experience I had the first time, I have done it many times since then and it dosen't appear to have any real effect on my brain so far, other than the flashbacks. Yes, the flashbacks. Honestly, I like them...A lot of people find them to be a nusence and rather scary, I seem to enjoy them. I have had many a friend want to kill themselfs and have to go through counseling cause they could not handle the effects of LSD. All in all, I really enjoy it :)
