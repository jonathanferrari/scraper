Background:
As far as things I've done before: Molly (pure MDMA), coke, Adderall, Xanax, tabs, oxys, kolonopins, various other pills and of course, weed. 

My Boyfriends Bkgrnd: let's call him D has done so much more then I have, he's only rolled 4-5 times but he's done all the things I've done plus heroin, crack, LSD, DMT and shrooms (all experimentation no actual regular use. He is a mind expanding experimenter like myself, not looking to have to fight an addiction problem). probably other things that I don't know about honestly. Although these days he mostly just smokes weed. 

Pre Consumption:
I am on birth control (Yaz), that is the only prescription drug that either of us are on. We did smoke weed that day, before and during the roll. We didn't fast, as we honestly weren't expecting to actually be getting these, as we had been trying for weeks. Then (we actually got really high and split a small pizza :-O) around midnight Saturday night I get a phone call from our friend B. B said he could get them and have them dropped off at around 12:30. I talked to D and we were excited, we were finally able to get them. It had been months since either of us rolled. The price was 10 per, which is pretty average around my area. 

Substance:
We were each taking 1.5 E pills. They were yellow and had a sort of lizard looking stamp on them. We received them Saturday night at about 12:30 am and took them around 1. We got them through a trustworthy friend who had taken these specific ones about a week previously, they had been tested to be sure that they were actually what we thought they were (with an at-home testing kit). 

+0:00 we took the first pills at around 1am. Washed them down with a red Gatorade. D is about to fall asleep on my couch and B is hanging out with us and my friend J who gave him a ride. 
+1:00 we split the third pill. We are just starting to feel the effects (the body rushes) I mostly felt it in my chest while D reported it more so in his legs
+1:05 B and J left, so we decide to walk to the nearest gas station for cigarettes. The walk was breathtaking. Being outside felt great. The fresh air was like breathing in fresh life. D kept looking at me with the biggest smile on his face. We both are definitely coming up.
+1:30 we got to the gas station, the stars looked so beautiful on our walk. And I felt so in love with and connected to D. When we walked in the gas station I felt as if as I was warming up my body was buzzing. It was like everything was beautiful and I could feel its energy, and its place in the world. We were stuck standing behind this woman who had to buy like 100 lotto tickets. We were waiting in line for 20 minutes and all we wanted was cigarettes.

+1:50 I am definitely rolling now. I finally get my turn to go up to the counter I ask for a pack of Marlboro Medium 100's and the cashier is talking to me about how someone spilled a Slurpee on the counter because they were high. And telling me how wrong it is to get high, all I could think about is how sad it is that someone could be so judgmental. I believe that if its your body and your mind and choosing to responsibly alter it isn't necessarily a terrible thing. After I go D buys 2 packs of gum after smelling every pack in the store. 

+2:00 we walk out of the store, and bust out in laughter. I grab D's hand and we set off back for my house talking about how funny it is that the lady was talking to us about the evils of getting high, as we were coming up on a much more seriously mind altering substance. We talked about why people need to get more open minded about drugs, and not quite so judgmental. Then we were talking about how beautiful the night sky was. It was so clear and the stars were so bright it was breathtaking. On the walk home I turned on some techno music because it just felt right, but I had it on low on my cellphone because it was really late and I didn't want to disturb the neighbors.

+2:25 we get back to my apartment. The first thing I did was turn on the music, louder this time. If  your interested it was Ellie Goulding Â– Lights ( Bassnectar remix) and we started having a deep conversation. And hugging and kissing and touching. We started dancing too. 

At this point I pretty much lost track of time. I was peaking from the first pill and the 2nd half is beginning to hit me. I am sweating but I feel great. The only  thing I don't really like about these pills is that they make me shake, a lot. I tried to pack a bowl and I had to make D do it because I was shaking too hard. We were listening to all kinds of music and we were having lovely conversations about us. I realized that I am in love with D and I am so ridiculously happy to be with him. I realized that he not only cared about me but he is there for me no matter what. and a bunch of other really deep stuff. Eventually we were sitting around, me without my shirt or bra on, playing with my kitten (Delilah) and D in just his boxers continuously shoving gum in his mouth (he kept telling me the flavor was like an orgasm in his mouth) and I kept basically chain smoking cigarettes (which is not very cost effective, they're 10 dollars per pack in NYS). We did have some mind blowing sex. It felt like my whole body was orgasming the whole time. When he came he came for like 20 minutes. It was amazing. And afterwards we just kept kissing and touching and cuddling. We talked about why kids are scary and why I don't want any for at least 10 years. We talked about our futures and our pasts and we talked about our friends. I felt like I was in a very loving place, with a wonderful person.

Somehow, around 8am we crashed. First I started getting really cold, so I wrapped myself in a blanket and it felt SOOO good. It was warm and cozy. D spent the night, and when I finally allowed him under my blanket he held me all night. I had some weird dreams but I don't really remember what they were. 

Come Down Day:
As always the next day sucked. The only thing I could think is that I really wish I would have gotten more. It was strong but not quite as strong as I am used to. This was the first time I took E pills, usually in my area you can just find Molly (the crystallized MDMA powder). My whole body was sore so me and D just spent the day watching movies and smoking. It felt better that way.  
 I got a much closer feeling with D and I feel that we have a better relationship because of it. E always seems to knock down those communication walls. Let's me say what I really feel without fear of rejection, because if I say it with love I expect respect for it.

Keep expanding your mind. Keep your realities changing/ Keep your heart growing. Keep learning and loving.
