Trip Report 

Mindset: Calm and collected. Had some issues with the kids earlier in the day, but they were happy, fed, and in bed. Meditated for about 20 minutes on "Om Tat Sat" to get prepared.

Setting: The Master Bedroom, on the bed, with my wife reading a book next to me. One lamp on, for her book, and a candle lit near me.

Dosage: 5g P. cubensis, Mazatapec, harvested two days ago, dried. Crushed up and dropped in boiling water with a dash of lemon juice. Let boil for 2 minutes, then steep for 5 minutes. Filtered out material and poured over ice mixed with grape Cool Aid.

Timing: Consumed the potion at exactly 10pm.

Combinations: Nothing; ate a light dinner 4 hours earlier. A bit of water and a bit of nicotine.

Notes: I tend to describe my experiences live on my private chat to some other friends. The following is a condensed and formatted version of those notes, along with time-stamps.

10:52 PM - &#8232;lots happening right now, can't describe [no more CEVs/hypnogogia, full on hallucination, many 3D tunnels and morphing shapes]
11:03 PM - things are weird, it's like using my sleep function [the mushroom was somehow triggering sleep in my body but keeping me conscious]&#8232;&#8232;
11:04 PM - &#8232;long periods of closed eyes, seeing random hallucinations, seems like gong to sleep&#8232;. peeing again&#8232;&#8232;

11:07 PM&#8232; - this song just saved my life &#8232;[link to Deepness Dawn - Alone]
11:09 PM - I'm seeing things im trying to really hard to describe even to myself. &#8232;i know them deeply and they've always been there&#8232;&#8232;
11:10 PM - &#8232;they're parts of thought&#8232;. like the shape and shadows of thought itself [at this point the hallucinations were very complex, yet familiar; seemed like I was seeing the structure of thought, looked like dark swirling eddies/flows of smoke and structure and meaning]&#8232;&#8232;
11:11 PM&#8232; - this is a very internal closed eye trip.&#8232;the mushroom is putting me into light sleep paralysis, i can feel it when it locks in&#8232;&#8232;
11:12 PM&#8232; - i can unlock it easily when i want&#8232;. its warm and cuddly&#8232;
11:14 PM - [link to ASURA - Lonely Star] this song is driving me deeper into the mindspace
&#8232;&#8232;11:18 PM&#8232; - at the beat drop i got brave and inspired and yelled in my head COME ON SHOW ME
11:19 PM&#8232; - then a full view of rainbow static/tv snow&#8232;. every little dot was a rainbow pulsing through every color&#8232;&#8232;
11:20 PM - &#8232;i get nausea when i have my eyes open too long, not seeing much out here anyway&#8232;&#8232;
11:21 PM&#8232; - mushroom wants eyes closed, ok mushie&#8232;&#8232;!
11:23 PM&#8232; - ok now its showing me like 80s guys with fancy mullets. &#8232;wtf mushroom&#8232;&#8232;
11:24 PM - &#8232;they're all like patrick swayze and kurt russell feathered hair guys

11:33 PM - now there's a bunch of hands, in a line going back into the dark, they're all like slowly flapping at me?&#8232;&#8232;
11:53 PM - &#8232;it has a full hold over my visual cortex only when I'm in this half sleep stage it locks me into&#8232;&#8232;
11:54 PM&#8232; - easy to lose sense of reality at this point&#8232;. its showing me many things and they're all un-english-able [at this point i lose the ability to communicate anything and get fully locked into sleep paralysis and deep hallucination, much time passes before I am able to communicate again]&#8232;&#8232;
1:16 AM - still having solid hallucinations, true hallucinations
&#8232;&#8232;1:17 AM - actually very little CEVs or OEVs, just the minds eye opened up and spewing out things to my visual cortex&#8232;. the imagination is a real thing.
