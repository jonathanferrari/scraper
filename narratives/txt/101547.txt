I took it on an empty stomach.  Took a good hour for the effects to kick in.  I just felt light, warm, peaceful and relaxed.  Planned the day off, and spent it on computer with friends, and listening to music.  Profound sense of peace and relaxation, with concessional tingles throughout my body.  

After five hours, the feelings diminished.  No discernible after effects other than feeling a bit more tired at night, and consequently sleeping very well.  Next morning was typical, no after effects, but I knew I had to get those feelings again.  Only took 1/2 dose because of my age.  

One thing -- the onset of high seemed very sudden, though not unpleasant.
