Beware of the power of K

I have experienced K over different periods of my life:

-tried it in a club - yuk
-again with friends in chilled situations.... Kind of fun and crazy
-alone with ear plugs and and a mask over my face - AMAZING. That was the first time I went into that alternate reality that I have no language in, or connection to my body in anyway - its frothing insane brain anarchy. 

Then I did it alone and this time (like 5 times in the night) and on the last one, I went so into it, I lost language, time, what was real - just that fractal fragmented time fucked space where I realise we are all connected - the minds - and that is the next level of consciousness and we are the god and our thoughts create matter create reality.

So thats all great, some people get it - HOWEVER, when I realized this,  the 'people' were telling me to 'stand up, stand up wake up get up into the next level' so my actual physical body stood up on my bed and I guess fell down off the bed into some hard shit and I broke 3 ribs didn't know it. I went through the trip for another 20 mins and was getting back to this body this reality whatever and realized I kind of hurt and I tried stretching and then I was getting out of breath. I had also collapsed my lung
RIGHT??? Fucking hell

So long story short, Ketamine was a great mind expander for me, I need to be careful with it - I won't leave a candle burning (or better yet, dont snort a rail and pass out beside the campfire.
