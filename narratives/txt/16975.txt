First Flashback

The last time I did LSD was nearly 4 years ago. It will be 4 years on 9/10/02. A friend of mine at the time gave me one. All I know it was orange, small, clear and square. So small I didn't think it would fuck me up as bad as it did. I came home from school and dropped it. Making the worst mistake of my life. It was the worst and most life injuring trip I had. It was so scary, I thought I was going to stay like that. I remember as this fact I will come back to later, I went outside at my father's advice. I put my sunglasses on, as my eyes were hurting in the sun. For 14 hours it seemed, I feared for my old mind. It subsided but the trauma had already been done. I had so many more thoughts, but so many more fears afterwards. Well time went on, school was just one big fear. Thankfully I only a 2 classes. Well 4 years passed, on Monday I was again with my father outside I had my sunglasses on, and it occurred to me, 'Do I really need my sunglasses?' It popped into my head when I last thought that, 4 years ago. We were going to home depot and I thought, I can't handle this. This was my first flashback, its been 3 days and I have only felt normal in the daytime and with my family around. But when I'm alone I feel very lonely and panicky. My feet begin to feel numb and my neck begins to hurt. Oh I hope this is temporary.
