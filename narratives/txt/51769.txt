I met a friend at Marsascala and I took half a hit at 8pm. 9pm nothing, 10pm nothing, went home, nothing.

10:30pm I took the other half hit.

11pm: I was in front of my computer, I began to see all the colours of the rainbow then time had no meaning. I became aware that I was 23 years earlier in side my mother's womb and in 70 years at the most I would be dead and buried. What is the significance of 70 years when 70 years from now, there will be only the past and no future. I felt that there was nothing after life, we are only mammals ant that thought was horrible. I always thought that there was life after death and that's what is beautiful. But now I realized the opposite. There is nothing, we are only a bunch of chemicals and we will get dissolved into nature. Just as there was no I before 23 years ago, there will be no I after I die.

I thought: what's the great thing if I die? So much people have died! There are so many people who will live.

Well after the 3 days I spent in this state I became involved in a religious movement that promoted life after death. I want life after death! If there is no life after death its not worth living.
