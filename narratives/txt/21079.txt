My two experiences smoking mushrooms have gone like this, the 1st time was at a house party, myself being drunk and high (mota) ambled into a room with 3 people smoking out of a water pipe.  I was informed it was mushrooms and inhaled a a time or three.  Honestly I can't remember how many, but it was a good sized bowl, probably about 2 grams or so in it.  The effect:  I went into the room fucked up and walked out stone sober.  I hung around the party for about another hour, got bored and went home.  I'm not sure if that was normal, but hitting that pipe completely zeroed me out.

#2 was about a month ago and I had about a gram left over after a fun night.  I only take mushrooms maybe 3 or 4 times a year, and eating two grams of these had me flying for about 8 hours.  That was on Saturday, Wednesday I found the remnant sac in my pocket (needed to do laundry), it was almost exactly one gram, which we smoked out of a schwag (mota) pipe, it took 4 bowls to smoke all of it, and it smoked SLOW, but in the end it was.....nothing, for either one of us, it may have not been enough but it was a pain in the ass to smoke that many bowls and get nothing, not even the tinglings of a rush or anything.  In my opinion, If I want to enjoy shrooms, I eat the mf'ers.
