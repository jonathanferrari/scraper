I bought a gram of squidgy black, it's a sticky black resin. (At time of report fully legal in my country.) I got a very small amount and rolled it into a ball, probably no more than 1-2mms in diameter and placed it in my bong with ice in.

Using a normal lighter, I got it to burn and took between 2-3 full hits, and I held them in for at least 10 seconds. By full hits, I mean the bong was full of smoke. It came on very quickly, no less than a minute after the first hit. 

My heart started fluttering, I feel a tingling throughout my body. I can't say this was immediately pleasant, I was worrying that I was having a heart attack, it wasn't painful, it just didn't feel right. My mouth became very dry. I became slower and more zoned out. Although I think that was made more prominent because I was listening to music with my headphones. (Tycho - Dive)

I was very zoned out, I temporarily forgot things. At one point I felt close to being sick, I tried to eat a biscuit and couldn't because I felt sick.  

After the first hour the effects started to slowly fade. The whole experience lasted about 2 hours. 

I would give it a 6/10 - Not horrible, not amazing, slightly interesting.
