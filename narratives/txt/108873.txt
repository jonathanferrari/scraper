DMT After-Results

I was a new DMT user while past in 2014. I extracted my own DMT with acacia rootbark. I got a crystal semi-clear DMT after a second successfully cook.

After a bowlpipe dose 20mg, I heard some flashbang noise in my ears. Suddenly the noise went down but continually, perpetually. I am hearing those flashbang sounds permanently, not so loud, but permanently since 2014/8. =|

I did many DMT doses before and also I went to a ayahuasca ceremony and nothing bad happened. But when I smoked at home this last time, I got a auricular/perma-sound that reminds me of a flashbang boom, like volume 1 (in a scale 1-10), but permanently.

Everyday I wake up, hearing this sound. It's creeping me out, driving me crazy nowadays, but I am fine, despite this weird sound. I did not seek a doctor yet. =|

I am from South Brazil.
