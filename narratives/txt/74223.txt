The following is a detailed account of my first experience with Psilocybin Cubensis.

I was 19 years old at the time, and many of my friends had tapped into the realm of hallucinogens.  There were drugs I thought I'd never try, and mushrooms was one of them.  After much build-up in my own mind, perhaps a month or more, I decided to see for myself what exactly was going on with this particularly peculiar drug.

My friend Brad and I agreed we would take it one evening when I purchased 7 grams from a friend.  We would split it right down the middle, having been told that an eighth ounce is required for a sufficient "trip".  I was also told that consuming them with orange juice, or vitamin C would enhance the colors and give a brighter feel to the experience.  So at midnight on the button we chomped down many dry caps and stems and washed it all down with a tall glass of orange juice.  The kinds of things that happened after this I wouldn't have believed if God himself told me they would happen.

T:00-Consumption-12:00am

We laid out in a grassy park nearby to Brad's house and decided we would look at the stars in the sky until something noticeable began to happen.  By about 12:50 the sky was getting a bit "fuzzy" and we both had an overwhelming energy to express something deeper than laughter.  We stood up and walked to an intersection with the most vivid green, yellow, and red lights I had ever seen in my life.  Like flies to a bug zapper we strolled over to the nearest lit object in astonishment.  There was a hospital on that street corner, a very large complex.  We found ourselves in the hospital parking lot, because that's where all of the lights were.  We sat down at a bench, thinking back on it, we were just begging to be pulled over.  We probably looked like the most suspicious characters ever.  I remember getting a phone call from a friend, and at that point, something happened.  Almost like a conscious crossing from one reality to the next.  There was a fire hydrant nearby and as though the energy we were harnessing at that moment of time was too much for our physical surroundings, it BURST shooting water 20ft in the air.  I didn't even double think this, we just looked at each other with the widest eyes and it felt as though the fire hydrant exploding for absolutely no reason directly in front of us was a metaphor for what just took place inside of my own mind.

We stupidly decided without any inhibition to walk deeper into the hospital complex, where we stumbled upon a massive structure.  The hospital was under complete construction and an extremely large part of it was just stories of buildings with no walls, just a freestanding structure about 5 stories high.  I remember at this point, that everything I was seeing around me was the first time I'd ever seen it before.  I was just pushed through the womb of another dimension.  I  remember constantly gasping out of my mouth and saying "ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" in the most astonishment of what I was witnessing imaginable.  We decided to go deeper.  We hopped a security fence guarding the unfinished wing of the hospital and made our way up the stairs to the wide open air of the 5th floor overlooking the city with the wind hitting us.  I remember an overwhelming warmth and separation from reality.  We sang the song I've got the whole world in my hands out loud together, bellowing it.  I remember shedding tears out of my eyes because the euphoria surrounding the event was too good for this earth, too good.  

There was some construction item draped with a black tarp below us and we caught ourselves staring at it.  Eventually we labeled it as a "big old moo cow". I thought it looked kind of like the grim reaper.  What we found inside of this unfinished wing of the hospital was undoubtedly the ideal situation for a first time mushroom trip.  Seemingly endless chasms of shiny silver lines walls, EVERYTHING was metallic.  Magnificent spikes of steel projected from the ceiling like we were inside a cave from another planet.  We stumbled upon an entirely full bucket of every color spray paint, every can full to the brim.  We each grabbed a color, Brad sprayed the color red on his black sweatshirt that created a mark I thought should have been on the sweatshirt in the first place.  There was a number "3" on a concrete box, and I sprayed the letters "r3al" on it for some reason. 

We continued down the cave and found ourselves not in a futuristic environment anymore, but in the dirty depths of rock and soil, no longer illuminated by the florescent lights behind us.  We sprayed what I called "the symbol of the Gods" on some concrete.  This image will never leave my memory.  It must be about 2:45am at this point, and Brad springs the news upon me that he has to be home or his mom will be angry..or something like that.  I felt it was an extremely shallow, earthly commitment compared to the magnitude of what we were experiencing that night.  We made our way back to his house, safely thank god, and sat outside for a little while longer rounding up the rest of the time we had together that evening before he went in.  A car drove up to us, stopped, and then threw something at us.  It was the morning paper.  Never has a paperboy caught me so off guardÂ—that guy got me so good.

Brad went inside to go to bed before his parents woke, and I was unfortunately left by myself.  By now it is about 4 am, and for fuck sake I was left by myself with the peak of the high only beginning to take hold.  I got in my car (I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS) and managed to drive to a 7 eleven where I thought what I wanted at the time was a bottle of water.  I purchased a bottle of Fiji water and I realized, sitting in my car, that I wasn't the least bit thirsty.  This is when the night started to turn very, very unpleasant.  A looping thought recurred in my mind over and over and over again.  I kept thinking that this certain drug was never supposed to touch a human brain, that once this shit makes physical contact with your mind you are permanently fucked and in a deep state of psychosis.

I drove all the way to my house and made loops around the block for 30 minutes not knowing where a good spot to go was, because I had told my parents I was spending the night at brad's, and I most DEFINITELY did not want them seeing me in that state of mind.  I found myself parked behind some trailer on a different friend of mines street.  It was there that I truly understood how deep a mushroom trip goes, and I only had about 2 hours left of the trip.  I laid in my car unable to sleep until the sun came up and I peaked my head out.  I saw a goat.  Yes a goat, on the horizon as the sun raised behind it.  It was a small farm.  I was just thinking, "what the fuck.how much crazier can this get?"  I drove back home, slept for 9 hours, and woke up with a new mind.  

It has been some time now since that night.  It changed the way I look at the world.  My friend Brad and I still bring up this event.  The space inbetween us is the tightest bond there is.  Everything is connected.
