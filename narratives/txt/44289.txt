It wasn't my first time with mdma, but it was my first time doing straight up molly.  I was at bonnaroo in Tennessee and the first night was my birthday. I got drunk all day long in the heat and then sobered up for some molly eating for a show at night.  

Everything was amazing at the show, everyone I camped with was rolling so it was a great bonding experience.  I saw bright lights and a really fast drummer and smiling faces.  It was amazing.  The next morning I woke up completely fine...excited about my previous night.  I blew some lines of coke and was constantly smoking and drinking.  Night time came and it was time to eat the E.

We all munched on some White Sunflowers for a late night Sound Tribe Sector Nine show. And it was amazing.  It was probably one of the best shows I had ever seen, and I will honestly thank some of the mdma for that!! But the hangover was terrible. After all the mdma eating and the past of depression (I was on prozac for 3 years until about 5 months before bonnaroo). I came down hard. I wasn't sure if it was because of the history of prozac or what...but the next morning I stayed in the car all day being upset but happy about the experience.  For some reason, I just couldn't get over the fact on how sad I was.

The only way I got through the day was my friend pulling me out of the van around 2pm and said that I would feel better if I took a lot of shots.  So I took about 5 shots, made a mixed drink and went to the next show and I felt fine. But I don't remember feeling as sad as I did that morning ever. It was horrible, but at the same time worth it.
