As reality fell a part his word stuck w me.

For a moment I thought I was gonna die and I tried to force my eyes open but that did not help so I relaxed and took controlled breaths and watched the symphony of the universe do its thing.

Amazed,he was eager to know he need to leave so an hr later he went back to ask! Disappointed in his questioning they left him with a feeling of imposition! After that, it was obvious to take heed of the aliens...
