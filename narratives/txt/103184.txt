Potent BHO infused rock sugar candy.  I had a lot at the 420 rally. Its hits fast with in 20 minuets I felt it.  I wander off walking to a teahouse.  My memories from that point on happen in 20 second increments.  Like every 20 seconds I get to look through my own eyes. Dragged away from my memory I was in that moment. I could recall sobriety but it was fleeting.  Once at the bridge my movements became a bit stiff.  My ankles did not move as they should.  Gravity, it seemed had its thumb on my head and solders but this only slowed me down. No paranoid thoughts and just a bit nervous. 

My trek was over, I was home.  Got some food in me and I felt better but still stiff.  I then had a nap. Upon waking I continued eating small bits of candy every 1-2 hours. I was couch-locked and later at 2 am I went to sleep.

So basically I had 3 doses at once.  The jelly candy sample and the hard candy sample and my cookie. 

It affects my memory.  Memories don't record that well. This afternoon I went for a walk to ferry terminal.  As of now I only retained segmented fragments of that walk.  It was if I was home then at the park with little or no memories of the journey between the two. This trend continued over my walk.  I remember sitting at the ferry terminal then at the wooden steps of the graveyard then the last 20 feet to home. The feeling of sun on my skin was magnetic. I was intaking sunshine. About 2 Km round trip.

Its 6 o'clock now and the small bits of candy I had this morning are still affecting me.

For 20 bucks that jar of candy has over 30 doses for me at least.  That combined with my low tolerance for this stuff. Makes it a great deal.
