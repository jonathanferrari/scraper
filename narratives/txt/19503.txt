I bought an 1/8 of mushrooms for 20 dollars from my normal drug connection and decided to smoke them since the day before I ate a eighth,and I didn't want to waste it by eating them since sometimes after doing them frequently in a short period of time I do not feel it as great.so I searched through my house for a pipe and could not find one so I then made a pipe with tin foil and smoked away the mushrooms. It was a marijuana like high I was  light headed had  enhanced sounds it was nothing like eating them slight paranoia a down kind of high and it felt as if  had enhanced senses.

Other people told me that smoking them would not get me high but I sure got high but it only lasted about 20 minutes. If already eating them I will definitely try this again.
