Recently my friend brought back some shrooms from a rural area in alabama. It was my first time to try them so I was slightly nervous when I took them which accounted for some problems I had in the trip. For the most intense part of the trip I was in my room listening to Pink Floyd and trying to keep a clear head and observe what was happening to my mind, body, and vision. I remember listening to 'Echoes' on Meddle and about halfway through the song they started to hit me. the floor on my room seemed to move in gentle waves as if made of water and all the objects in my room seemed to float just above it.. About this time the walls started to seem to breath in and out and objects shrank away from me as if I was growing taller. 

For the first 45 mins or so of the trip I was feelin pretty mellow with it all. Then the nausia hit... I descided to smoke a little bit o' green to ease the nausia and marijauna once proved its medicinal uses. about that time all my friends got back and we all started to watch movies and just describe what was going on in our heads. I remember that whenever I closed my eyes I would see columns of ever changing light spiriling up endlessly. brightly colored images flashed through my head often melting and bending from one to annother.

I also remember that whenever I would look at anyone's face that they would start bending off in random directions. all in all the visuals lasted for about 3-4 hours with the body vibe lasting about 6 hours. I remember that whenever I saw all these quite unusual things that I usually just smiled hardly caring as if it were nothing unusual. Definitely a great experience. hope to do it again.
