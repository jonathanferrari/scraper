I lived in the dorms my first year in college.  I have tried mushrooms before, but I had a bad experience.  I thought I would try them again and try to have a good time.  We (my roomate and I) took them at the dorms.  Waited 15 minutes, and then went to a party.  We were trying to time it out where we could drive to this party, and then start trippin' when we got there.

Everything is going cool, until we get to the party, and we were like 2 hours early, so no one was there.  I start to feel the mushrooms when we leave the house.  I get into my car and sit there.  I start trippin' hard.  We didnt know where to go, so we thought we would head back to the dorms.  I tried my hardest not to wreck, or get pulled over.  Lights were everywhere, and I couldnt tell what was real.  

We finally get back to the dorms.  Walking up to the building, there are people everywhere dressed up all crazy.  It was Halloween, so there were hundreds of people leaving the dorms to go to parties.  We tried our hardest to look straight, and not look like complete idiots.  There were echos everywhere.  We looked like the Fear and Loathing Ether scene.

We finally get up to our room after a difficult time in the lobby.  I then laid in bed and just listened to music.  It was amazing.  Everything was pink and green and vivid.  I looked at my hand, and my fingers swirled off of my hand.  After listening to Pink Floyd for an hour or so, my friend comes to pick us up.  We went to a party, and I didn't like it. I went out to the car to listen to music.  I thought I was Jesus.  My friends came outside after a while.  We started talking, and I was just out of it.  I couldn't remember what weed was.  I didn't know what ecstasy was.  I didn't know where I was.  At the time it was weird.  But I look back at one of the funnest trips ever.  I learned that if you just stay positive and comfortable, you will have a good time on mushrooms.
