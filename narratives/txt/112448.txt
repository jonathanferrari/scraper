First Time on Magic Mushrooms

Had a mate that regularly went out looking for wild mushies in a spot that was always fruitful. They made a pot up of Magic Mushie tea and gave me a cup, with a ginger ale to help the taste. 

Took a little bit to kick, and when it did, it was quite subtle. Everything was a lot more bright and colourful. The room felt far too tiny, and the furniture grew massive, bigger than the walls should have been. Everything was both too big and too small at the same time. The ceiling fan was on and I became very focused on the chilled air temperature, watching my feet hanging off the couch. My brain had rationalised that since my body was warm and my cold legs were hanging off an edge, my legs were in space. I could see my legs on the couch and the floor underneath it, but it still made sense to me that my legs were hanging off the edge of the universal.

Was a fantastic trip, still kept a logical sense of think and rational thought, yet disconnected from it all at the same time
