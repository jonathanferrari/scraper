My dorm mates and I took quite a few drugs during our first year in college.  This included acid, mushrooms, lots of marijuana and XTC.  

The latter was by far the most pleasant experience any of us had ever had.  My experience with the substance is pretty much what I see mentioned elsewhere.  However there was one difference.  All of us experienced painful backaches the next day in addition to the 'wiped-out' feeling normally experienced.  The backaches were centered in the lower portion of our backs, and lasted for approx 18 hours.  After about a year of this, we concluded that MDMA was simply too dangerous and we gave it up.  

I'm 38 with four young children, and I still sort of miss that drug.  I haven't taken any drugs in 15 years.
