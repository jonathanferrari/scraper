Ok, there was a night in the summer when I was just driving around with my neighbor and he pulled out some acid and I took like 3 hits. Then I asked if I could take the other 2 so I did. About 25 or 30 minutes later I started to just wig out. When I got in his basement his carpet had likes little minature towers and there were like red laser beams coming out of them. Then I sat down in the chair, and the wall just started spining and melting and shit and the t.v started to get that slow echoy pitch to it. 20 minutes later I was seeing spining hexes when I closed eyes. Then I left his house and got lost in the woods. So I was freaking out and crying. I finaly found my house cause I got lucky. So I went up stairs and the stairs were like moving and they were wavey. Then it was pitch black in my sisters room so I just layed down there. I was seeing all of these cool Like hexs and things from like windows media player, like the graphics they have on it. Well I was staring at the ceiling for at least  2 hours and then played guitar. Couple hours later I had to go to summer school, and my trip started to just get worse. I couldnt write my name or anything. I remember saying to my friend nick 'I'm trippin my balls off', and he just laughed. Then there was this tile in the school that was just spinning and coming out at me and shit, it fuckin amazed me. After I got home I stopped seeing things but still had the anxiety and shit.

Welp yep that sums up my story
