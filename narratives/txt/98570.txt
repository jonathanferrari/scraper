Before I try to explain my 'trip', understand that describing it is like trying to describe color to a blind person. I intended to take it to obtain some sort of spiritual experience... I was in for a suprise!

About an hour and a half after eating this sour nutty substance my mind started to process thoughts very differently, I couldn't figure out how things worked, I understood why but could not figure out the how. 

As time progressed I began to feel very strong emotions, emotions that I've tried to suppress through out my life, such as the feeling of being embarrassed, all of my deep rooted fears were being forced in front of me, there was no escape, no turning the tv on or playing a game, I had to face them. This is and was the most frightening experience of my life. However I was also shown something else. 

Thinking about it now I realize that there was something or someone... Like some sort of supreme intelligence was communicating with me, telling me that my fears are nothing and I'm choosing to be afraid, in doing so my fears were blinding me from my purpose. This was also shown to me, not what or how to achieve it, instead it just let me know that there is such a thing, 'a purpose'. 

My ego was shattered, I was everything at once, I was no longer I... Again frightening beyond description, no rationalizing was going to bring me to a conclusion because there is no conclusion. 

Unfortunately I can not describe how profound my total experience was.
