A friend of mind hooked me up with something new, two capsules, which were said to contain Ketamine. It was a very light, grey powder. I decided to experiment with one of my boys who had also never experimented with Ketamine. We walked into the woods, sat down, and opened a capsule (I was not willing to ingest what was an unknown amount). I ate two bumps, about the size of two peas. My boy was more daring than I, he ate twice as much. It was very bitter.

As we walked, I noticed a nice calming effect, unlike any barbituate or benzodizapine, which I am not incredibly fond of. I definately felt tranquilized, chillin on the porch. It made me laugh, and yes, I must say it had a bit of a psychadelic effect on me. Strangely, although I felt tranquilized, I was not tired. My boy, who ingested about twice as much as I, was not too lucid. He seemed to be semi-conscious, in a content state as well. We both laughed quite a bit through the experience, even through the snide comments and meows coming from our friends.

Overall, I found it to be a positive experience, as I did not acquire any ill feelings during or after. Thumbs up.
