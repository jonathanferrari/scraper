Smoking Mushrooms

Me and a friend of mine Dan came into a large amount of mushrooms and got tired of eating them, so we ended our trip and the next day tried smoking them. At first smoking mushrooms may taste bad, but its an aquired taste, after about 3-5 hits I dont really taste how bad it is anymore (not that its that bad anyways, it smells worse then it tastes).

We also found out that the lucky number for us was 3 bowls, after the 3rd one I felt a strange feeling, not like a high on pot, its closer to a hash high, but its still kinda of different, such as in my case I saw a radio tower with blinking lights, and when the light would blink it sent out rays in every direction of red light. Then I went and looked at the stars, and they seemed brighter and more real then usual, there was also a sort of pale redish green/blue halo around the sky and some of the brighter stars.

All and all the experience was similar to eating mushrooms, but it was still different in its own way, it is definetly something I would do again, but it is not as 'trippy' an experience as eating mushrooms.
