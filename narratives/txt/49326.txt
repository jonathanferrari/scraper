I would like to share my experience about using MDMA. The hangover/day after to be exact. Before I took the pill, I first decided to eat some oranges and peanuts. Vitamins and other stuff dat could minimize the hangover that I might have got. 

The next days I felt just completely normal and maybe even better than that. I aspected I would be pretty down (because of the serotinin overkill), but in fact, I was quite happy all week after I took it. I think that the hangover is mostly caused by taking more than just one pill on certain parties and not eating afterwards.
