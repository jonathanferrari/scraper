This year at the Coachella festival in Indio, California, I had my first MDMA experience.  I was backstage with a girl that I had met that day, drinking tequila, and waiting to watch the Arcade Fire perform from side stage.  On the way over I took a small blue pill of MDMA, from 'a good source,' and waited for the onset and effects.  I was already in a euphoric mood; I was backstage at a huge concert, some of my favorite bands were playing, I hadn't smoked weed (for once), and I was with a beautiful girl. She sat by me as the drug began to take effect.  The first thing I felt was reminiscent of my first experience with mushrooms; my heart began beating faster, and I could feel a quick onset of the drugs effects.  At first I began to feel overwhelmed, but quickly I stabilized and began to really feel amazing.  My euphoria was enhanced tenfold.  I was high, loving the world, and dying to talk to my girl about music, and her, and how much I cared for her, etc.  I felt like I was having the greatest day of my life.  On a sidenote, my Dad was also hanging backstage, floating around, and I found it reasonably easy to avoid letting on that I was extremely fucked up on drugs.  However, I got a bad feeling when I thought about trying to converse with him while on drugs.  The euphoria came on about 45 min-1 hour after taking the pill.  The effects lasted for about 5-6 hours, and I felt extremely good for the next 3 days.  Music sounded better; kissing felt more passionate; the lights and people seemed more interesting, and everything in general was more positive.  Its more euphoric than mushrooms, gets me feeling better than weed, and lasts for about 3 times longer than either.  Best drug I ever did.
