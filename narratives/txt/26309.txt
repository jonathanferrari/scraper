This was my second experience with mushrooms. I had taken them once about 5 months previous to this experience. For my first trip I had only consumed approximately 1 gram of mushrooms with cannabis and had had a very fun interesting trip.
   
I started at about 10:15pm by taking about 2.5grams of shrooms. I then relaxed in bed for about 20 minutes at which point I smoked 1 bowl of cannabis. I then returned to bed and watched my lava lamp and listened to the radio. The trip started very gradually around 10:45 and didn't peak until about 12:00 at which point the lights in my room and the radio became too intense to be able to handle, so I proceeded to turn them off. 

I layed back down and looked around my room and began to see that everything was made up of miniscule patterns all conjoined to make up a barely conceivable grand design.   I was also able to 'see' my room in perfect clarity and color with my eyes closed. This continued and some other visuals that I don't completely remember continued until about 2am at which point I have no recollection of what happened afterward. At about 4am I remember looking at my watch, not knowing where I was and not remembering what had happened during the past 2 hours. After I realized my surroundings and gathered myself, I fell into the worst and most unexplainable depression that I have ever experienced (depression is very uncommon for me, I am usually a very happy or in a good mood). The depression fortunately lasted only about 15 or 20 minutes after which it faded away. Even though I was no longer hallucinating I was unable to sleep all night. 

While the depression, sleeplessness, and blackout was definitely negative it was not so much so as to keep me away from shrooms forever. The hallucinations are more than enough incentive to use them again.
