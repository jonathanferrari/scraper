One day I meet up with an old friend. He asks if I want to 'blast off'. I soon find out this meant to smoke Deamsters(dmt). A group of 5 of us went to a near by walking trail at a locally notorious hippy college. We packed a small amount of chronic in a bowl then dabbled small amounts of dmt on top, and continued the process till the bowl was full.

The one who supplied it hit it with powerful lungs and passes it. Not a word is said during the ingestion, and the experience. We are all eager to try this new substance we know very little about. Once it gets to me I'm told to hit it hard, so that is what I do. Almost instantly after inhalation I begin to feel things. There was a small sort of bubble or pressure in the back of my neck, and my vision began to distort (very similar to lsd). The pressure wasn't unpleasant just odd. It traveled up the back of my head and seemed to fade into my face. As it faded my vision became more intense. The trees started to become two-dimensional almost as if pasted on to the sky. We were sitting on the top of a hill in the woods. The ground started to breathe as I did. It also seemed like it had a heart beat. During all of this no one spoke, we all just watched the mystical world we were surrounded in. I wouldn't say I completely 'blasted off', but I definitely had an amazing experience. My review of DMT is an A+. I'm looking forward to trying it again.
