This was certainly one of the best days I've had in a long time. I pick up my friend, well call him M. We come back to my house and eat 2 grams of dried mushrooms each, with a glass of orange juice.

We started watching Grandma's boy, which is great. About halfway through the movie we could really feel it. People started changing colors, it looked like my ceiling was made of worms. 

Upon standing I felt dizzy and had a hard time walking. My hands seemed to be unreal. My pupils became so dilated I could hardly tell  what color my eyes were. We then started watching that 70's show, a crazy episode, a Halloween episode. It was so trippy we watched it twice.

After it was over and we ate some burgers we just started talking about life. How this is our senior year, and it's half over. All the school we've gone through all comes down to 5 seconds in June. 

I know it's not too detailed. I had no bad experience at all, this is my 2nd time with shrooms and I'm gonna try to hook up an ounce soon. I drink now and then and smoke daily, but this has become my favorite thing to do. 

It's put my life into perspective, my relationships, people around me, ect. I have a greater appreciation and a newfound happiness.
