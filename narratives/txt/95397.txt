This was my first time trying MDMA. I had very strong perceptions about what it was going to be like based on experience reports and hearsay. I associated it as a club drug, so I assumed it must do really trippy things to you. It turned out to be completely different than I expected.

My friend had obtained some MDMA and we were quite excited to try it out. When we got a free night, we cut up the powder into 100 mg dosages, and mixed it into water. Tasteless. No big deal.

We sat down and put on some good music. We were just chilling when all of the sudden, whoosh, I feel a warmth to my body and a cottony feeling to my skin. I tried rubbing my arms, it felt pretty awesome. Not mindblowing or anything, just a nice pleasant feeling on my skin. I had a little grin on my face for some reason.

Then I just started talking to my friend, and the words flowed out so easily! I had no idea it was going to have this effect. I felt like all of 999 things I'd been thinking about but never talked about were just suddenly being effortlessly expressed. I also called my girlfriend that night and had what I think was the best conversation of my life with her.

Overall I was just shocked by how far off my perceptions about MDMA were. It didn't blow my mind with visuals, or audio, or anything like that. I just felt warm and wanted to talk a lot.
