Having been fortunante enough to come across DMT in southern Ontario, Canada, through an exchanged of about a half ounce of cannabis for this gram of refined DMT powder, which had made its way from Oregon, my distributor mentioned he had tried it but had achieved nothing spectacular.

He sold me the powder along with a pipe. The powder was an orange sherbet sort of color and was very fine. I did a trail run and took a pinch out of my pile. The smoke was thick and white. The taste of the smoke was awful, reminding me of burnt plastic or something like it. The smoke was very harsh even after several hits.

I noticed the effects within 10 seconds of taking and holding the hit. My extremities became colder and my palms began to sweat. Colors became sharper and more pastelish, yellows became particularily vibrant. There wasn't alot of perceptual distortion in comparison to mushrooms but the closed eye visuals were just as intense featuring multidimensional rooms and drapes of patterns and shimering colors. The effects subsided relatively quickly so I began brewing up more dmt. I felt a sense of megalomania and a mild sexual stimulation. I never smoked enough to break through but the experience was quite rewarding.

Psychologically I had the same sort of reaction as I did with other tryptamine psychedelics. At first I had a regretful sort of response, a 'when will this end' or 'i don't want this', but on another occasion I felt a sense of empowerment, a sense of fortitude and purpose, 'not to waste any time'.

I have not returned to the DMT realm in some time but this is not due to a negative experience. I did try and use DMT to enhance a sexual experience but its effect was too subtle for that activity.
