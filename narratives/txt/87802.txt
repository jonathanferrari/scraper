I took half a pill at 1am at a party a few night ago. In 30 minutes I was feeling fantastic. Nothing was bad, nor could it ever be bad. I wanted to be around everyone I was with, I wanted to move and touch people and wish that everyone was as happy as I was. 

I took a few shots of tequila, which I didn't feel at all. About an hour later I took a whole capsule orally and waited. It took less time to hit me than the previous dose. I was floored after this one, I have a few memories of the next 2 hours, and most of them are very happy ones. I walked and walked and I didn't want to stop. 

3 hours after the initial dose I was at home and it was 4am. I didn't get to sleep until 6am, slept until 8am and woke up feeling just as irritable as I had before I fell asleep. The after effects of the alcohol started to finally hit me and I felt sort of dizzy. I noticed that I had ground my teeth so hard I cut up the inside of my cheek. I got to sleep finally almost 24 hours after the initial dose, with little naps taken in between. I felt like shit the entire day, useless, sad, irritable, all around bad. I drank alot of water and hung out with my friends and that kept me in a sane mood. 

Over 48 hours have passed and I feel good today. No noticeable side effects, aside from not totally being as happy as I think I could be.
