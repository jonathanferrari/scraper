3 years prior to this experience I had a bad slip and fall where I took 2000 pounds of blunt force trauma to the back of my head, ruptured 2 cervical disks and an EMG showed nerve damage in my right arm. My arm would hurt so bad I could not lift my hand to my mouth to feed myself. Try eating with your non-dominant hand, it isn't so easy! Anyhow...  

I have used LSD and MDMA recreationally, probably 20 LSD trips and 5 MDMA experiences in 20 years. So I am no head but no green pea either. I had never done mushrooms before. I just ate the eighth ounce raw because I have a stomach of nails. 

After about an hour I started getting a feeling of happiness and well being, but my nerve pain kept interfering and I was afraid it was going to give me a bad trip, so I laid in bed and began meditating, trying to focus on happy thoughts. My eyes were closed. Suddenly I was visualizing a temple dome, with levels of different-colored light workers or angels. Each level had different colors, I was on the bottom, which was pink. These light beings lifted me up and began chanting or praying, and directing light into my arm. I could visualize the light penetrating all of my nerves and then POP! Instantly light broke through one area and my pain was gone. I got out of bed, it had been about a half hour, and went out in the back yard where I spent the next 3 hours goofing on nature, laughing at the wind making the grass wave at me and being so grateful for the squirrels which had obviously been put here solely for my amusement. Or me for their's, they laughed at me too.

I had no nerve pain in my arm for six months after that whatsoever.
