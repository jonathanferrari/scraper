##EROWID_NOTE:EXTREME_HIGH_DOSE##

In my freshman year of high school, I discovered the wonders of ecstasy, it was a mind blowing experience and I became quite of an eTard that year. It was normal for me to drop an ecstasy tablet almost everyday. One day, I was bored so I decided hell, I'll drop all of em that are in my pocket. First, I swallowed 3 tablets orally.

About 15 Minutes later, I crushed the remaining 8 tablets and poured it into a small bottle of water, I drank it all down. A few minutes later, I was in the zone, I was soo high. It felt as though my body was disconnected from my legs and that I was floating.

Soon enough, the entire world seemed to warp as time slowed down to almost a standstill. It was insane. I remember looking up at a clock to check the time and it taking me about 10 seconds for my eyes to stop shaking to focus on the clock. It was amazing.... I can't quite remember all the details ( it was THAT mind numbing ) but I do remember the comedown.

Oh man, worst comedown in my life. I sweat SO MUCH it was coming down from my face, hair, arms, legs, EVERYWHERE. It was so uncomfortable and the next day, and for the next couple days. If I stood up from sitting down anywhere or moved my eyes from where they've been concentrated a while ( i.e. a TV) the world would swivel around and everything would shake and become distorted for about 5 seconds. Do I regret doing this? Not one bit. Looking back on it, it was probably one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
