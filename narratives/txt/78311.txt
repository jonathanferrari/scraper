I had been interested in DMT for a couple of years now, but could never come across it. Finally after much patience the substance became available to me. I have had much experience with psychedelics before such as many LSD doses and even more psilocybin mushroom excursions. It has been a bout six years since I have used hallucinogenic substance. 

I was drawn to DMT because it is known as the 'business man's trip' and its rumored intensity. Well, I could say that this was truly one of the most amazing experiences I have had. Long story short here's how it went down. I sat on a couch in a dimly lit room at 6:00 am. I inhaled the first time and could instantly feel my body getting out from under me. I sucked in one more hit and WHAM! It was time for lift-off. It felt as if my body was projected at an accelerated speed. I closed my eyes and struggled to watch the constantly transforming images that surrounded me. These beings were straight out of the mayan or aztec sculptures and reliefs. It was like I was looking at an organic kaleidescope of beings who morphed into one another as well as objects. I described to my friend as being in the valley of the kings. It was astounding and terrifying all at once. As I began to come out of it the beings cleared away and tunnel lay ahead of me. It was made up of spinning machine-like objects, with similar objects inside of the objects. I opened and my eyes and was dumbfounded.Only five minutes had passed.
