Walking home after smoking so much weed I felt like I was a big system, I felt like I was a robot so I had to consciencely tell my legs where to go with each step feeling like a earthquake of euphoric sensations.

After a minute I had audial hallucinatons. Sounding like waves of a harp like noise plus some weird bass/beat all in sync.  I was walking a few miles with fattest grin of my life, (this wasn't my first time or anywhere near) I tried to grab my face and physically change the smile, my face felt like rubber, I couldn't  remove the smile I was too happy. 

When I arrived home I made some cereal because munchies, it tasted a lot more intense and I could feel the chewing more.  I turned a call of duty game on and was utterly destroying the other team without even thinking hard, it was like my subconscious was focusing on the game  like my life depended on it but consciously I was in space, one of my best highs in my life,
