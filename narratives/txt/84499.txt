I had waited very patiently for the right opportunity to try DMT  and it finally appeared to me. Purity was verified by the chemist. I loaded ~40 mg into a base pipe and lit with a bic. The taste was somehow familiar. The rising pitch began as I had expected and the room started to shake violently and this violent shudder spread into my hands when I looked at them and into the pipe and up my arm. My friends face then decompartementalized (if you will). I then remember kinda waking up into a dream of looking a woman through a window, but I also felt like I was at the same moment in another place I was familiar with. These clips were filled with visuals of snakes with scales that bled into each other and formed more snakes. I came back into the space I was in very quickly and I was looking at my two friends, I felt like myself again! But the funny thing was... I WAS STILL TRIPPING HARD! Like a mushroom trip but the scenery change made the normal hallucinogenic bit seem like normalcy.
