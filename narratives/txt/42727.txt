It started when me and a friend of mine named Matt went to pick up some psilocybe mushrooms.We went to talk to the person who was getting them for us.So we met at a friend's house.We gave her the money and she went to pick them up from out of state.So why she was doing that we sat around and smoked cannabis.Two hour passed before she showed up.She walked up to me and Matt and said 'Take these smelly things'.So we took the half ounce and left.We got back to my house where a couple of friends waited for us to return.We got inside where we separated the mushrooms.Matt got an 8th,I got the rest.Two seconds later Matt had already eaten his.I gave an 16th of an ounce to my friend Edd and ate a 4th of a ounce through out the night.Suddenly I noticed the posters on my wall looked like it was shaking.Then Matt bursted out laughing uncontrollably.He was laughing so hard he bumped his head againsthis knee.

Then my trip started to take shape. My head felt heavy and I just felt all around out of my mind,which was nothing new same as every other time I took shrooms.I started talking to myself and pacing back and forth.Then we decided we needed some fresh air.So we went outside and started smoking a bowl of cannabis.Then I looked up at a tree and seen double.I heard a noise from the ally.It sounded like an engine and it was.Of course my First thoughts were police but it was just a friend of mine we climbed in his car the walls were breathing in on me.After that We went inside were I repeated 'I'm going to die' and started pacing again.Then I started peaking I curled up in a ball and rocked for what seems like minutes but was actually hours.Every time I closed my eyes it felt like I was flying through my head and soon I could not open my eyes.And just like that it was done.All in all it was an ok trip the next day I shroomed again.It not being anywhere nere as intence as the night before,Dawm Tolorence.Write you guys next time I shroom.
