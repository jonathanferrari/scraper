Amazing Life Changing Experience

I was planning on taking MDMA for quite some time now. I went to my friends party with my boyfriend and finally decided to take it. It was my first time so I was nervous but at the same time extremely excited. 

I hadn't felt anything until about 45 minutes which was about 6:45. I started feeling relaxed, pretty nice at about 7 or 7:15 I started to reach my peak and I felt great. I felt like no one could judge me and that I was so close with everyone. I met some new people downstairs and then later went upstairs with my boyfriend. We just recently got back together after a long break up so we had been through a lot. While we were on MDMA we decided to just lay in bed and listen to music and touch each others skin; it felt amazing we felt closer together just laying there not saying too much just enjoying each others presence. I felt as if we were connected in some way, completely comfortable and just laying there with no worries or doubts, I felt like he would be there for me through everything; secure, which is a feeling I hadn't felt for a long time. 

We were with each other the whole night talking about things we wouldn't have normally talked about. I cant describe the feeling I had with him except absolute bliss. This drug has actually changed our relationship- and my life. Before our breakup we were barely speaking to each other and after a 2 month breakup we got back together and took this drug. After we felt so close and connected and that feeling has stayed for the past 4 months, I love him more than anyone and MDMA helped me realize that.  

I don't regret this as in a way it has completely changed my life for the better because I finally have a person I can turn to for anything.
