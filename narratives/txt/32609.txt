To begin I have eaten shrooms many times before and definatley felt effects.However smoking is entirely differrent.

T:2:00 a.m
Just cleaned my pipe to get some resin and smoked about four or five tokes and got a good buzz, I also took some diphenhydramine 25 mgs. Since I'm out of weed at the time,but I grow my own shrooms so I decided to try smoking some.

T:2:10 a.m
Packed the bowl with some shooms that werent to big but together weighed about a gram.I took the first toke and the smoke wasn't to bad. (kinda like scwagg weed and some shroomyness)Second toke and I start to feel weird and there is a pressure in my head and my hands look very odd.some colors are heightened. Third toke and there is definitely an effect Visuals,patterns,pressure in head and ears. Inability to think rapidly.

T:2:20 a.m
The bowl is cashed in 3 tokes and now I have some CEV's like colors and shapes

T:2:30 a.m
The effects are tapering somewhat but I'm still buzzed no more visuals either.

T:2:40 a.m
Effects are pretty much gone
