        I did some ecstasy on Saturday. I got it from a guy I work with.
It was a nice surprise! I bought a 'Full Moon,' or what was supposed to be
two doses. I'd gotten MDMA a few times in '89 and '90, but it wasn't that
strong... of course that was $8-10 and the Full Moon cost me $30. It was a
white powder, like the other stuff I'd had, in a clear gelcap.

        A major snowstorm was predicted Saturday night, so I waited until
it started snowing then took the whole thing, at around midnight. It hit
me real slowly, and in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours I peaked. I spent an hour or
two curled up on the floor just thinking. I couldn't keep my eyes open
because the natural beauty and beingness of everything was just too
intense. The most mundane objects took on a new light, things were
beautiful simply by being what they were. A totally different experience
from LSD, mundanely beautiful rather than cosmically and intensely
profound. It was very insightful in a simplistic way. I went out in the
snow that had built up to about 5 inches by then. The beauty of everything
in virgin snow with big fluffy flakes falling heavily... I can't describe
it. Heavenly. I finally fell asleep around 6. I awoke to a world changed
by snow and a self changed by ecstasy. Its left me with a sense of
purpose, renewal, and focus on the now.
