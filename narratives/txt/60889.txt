Awesome first breakthrough

One thing when I got there, it seemed as if there was a very bright energy channel, really bright, and it felt like it was 
pulling me towards it, but I went a different direction. This energy field, it was at the 10 o'clock position and moved towards the 11 and I ended up going towards say the 3 o'clock and it seemed as if there were say 5 or so  'people' standing there just looking at me.

Then my eyes opened and I saw a face in the plywood above me and then it seemed everywhere. As I went towards the right and what appeared to be a few 'people' standing there looking at me and then my eyes opened, they were looking at me and I was like they are everywhere... all around us... all around everything.  

Then my eyes closed and it felt as if I was wanting to be drawn back in, but nothing.

I saw these energy fields and what it seemed was there was a few layers of this, and maybe comprised of these smaller background entities? It also seems that I was without mind and I could not think for myself  just be. I was just there in this truth.   First thing when I gained control of my mind was say thank you for this and thank you for showing me this and then I thanked you....then I spoke....' Wow'.
