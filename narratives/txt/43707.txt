I come from an southern african country where the strength of marijuana is low in comparisone with a european marijuana. I had been smoking many years before I met a guy who had some 'european' weed. The first time I smoked a joint (without tobacc0) at his house, I sat back in a big chair and started to feel light. There was music playing and people speaking in the backround but I seemed to have turned them down. I began to feel my head almost open and found an incredible (and frightening) sence of breaking outand floating. I could have taken off at that moment but didnt, because I was scared. Scared of not being able to go back into my body. At that moment I slipped back into my body in no time at all. I have since tried to get the same result, unsuccesfully. :(
