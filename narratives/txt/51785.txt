My friend and I split an 8th of kabenzi's mushrooms for our first time. We ate the shrooms in a peanut butter sandwhich at about 5:30. We didnt start to feel the effects for about 30 minutes. 

Time-45 minutes in...we started to clearly feel the effects of the shrooms. Everything was different and a new experience. The walls were drifting away and the room was getting bigger. Sitting across the room from my friend we both stretched out our arms and saw them stretch and collide into eachother knowing this was impossible.

1 hour in...as my friend and I were walking outside to get into a car...I noticed the trees and bushes vibrating and moving in ways I never thought possible. As we got into the car and started moving...I thought I was in a space ship...honestly. I almost had the nerve to count down from 10. Then we stopped at a school and smoked a blunt...made things a bit better.

2 hours in....we came back to my house and thats when the hullicanations really began. I was laying on the floor...not having any will power to move. I thought I was dead and I could still see everything happening almost like I was in a CSI episode. About 10 minutes later after I snapped out of it I was still on the floor but I saw black vines come out from underneath my table. Then I saw more vines come out of the ceiling.

2 hours 30 minutes in....I saw the walls breathing and waving in different motions. Everything I looked at had a different color aura to it...some yellow, some pink, and some purple. I also saw the girl from the movie 'The Ring' come out from behide an entertainment system and look at me and go away.

3-6 hours in...the rest of the night I dont remember what happend...but it seemed like time slowed wayy down and every minute was its own hour. I had the best sleep I'v ever had in my entire life and the next day I felt great.
