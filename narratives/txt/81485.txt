Me and a buddy of mine wanted to try drugs, have asthma so pot was out, dont want to get into any chemicals so most everything else was out then I remembered mushrooms. Researched them on different government websites and stoner run websites talked about them with my stoner friends and decided I was going to be a full blown mushroom head. 

One night my friend and I went and bought 4 grams and split it, about half an hour later someone said I was god and that stuck with me all night. We locked in a track and field by my old school, it was like a gods playground for me. I looked at the stars and discovered how cool everything was and felt like a whole new world. Then I wanted a change an adventure, and one of my sober friends let us out of our playground cage and it was like venturing into a different dimension. We walked to a park and I discovered sand and trees and how interesting everything was. Then some guy came rippin around the corner in a jeep and did a burn out, I wanted nothing more than to go back to my gods playground.

That night I made the realization that no matter what you do or where you go, you always end up back where you felt the most at home.
