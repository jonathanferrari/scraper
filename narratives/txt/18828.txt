I recently went to a doof on the north coast of NSW Aus, I had a great time.  I dropped 2 different pills 1.5 hours between, one of which i have had many times before.  I became pretty much paralytic, and had mild hallucinations.

2 weeks later i went to a rave, had 2 pills 1.5 hours between, nothing, except a little bit happier.  I had a break of 1 week, went to a concert, had 1 pill and some G, the G was awesome, but barely felt my pill. had another 1 week break.  Then last weekend, had a trip the night before the doof, then went to the doof, 2 pills, 1 point, same thing again, felt a little happier, but nowhere near the experiences that i have had before.
I'm thinking i need a little break but everything is way too tempting.  I'm going to HAVE to take a couple of months break so i can once again enjoy my drug of choice.

I don't know whether it could be the prescription drugs that i am on, warfarin, cipramil (which i don't take if i'm planning on dropping) and Flower essences (i'm a case study for a friend at college).
