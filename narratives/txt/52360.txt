Like any other day, my brother and I were driving to Ultimate Frisbee practice at the local park, rolling some joints and listening to Phish, when we met up with three other frisbee companions and proceeded to smoke all five joints in our van, when we finished, ready and in the proper state of mind for a serious game of frisbee, we stepped out of the billowing side door and walked from the parking lot five feet to the field. Immediately, I felt the calming effects of the tasty bud, and kept humming my favorite Phish song (bouncing around the room), when it happened. 

How can I accurately describe an out of body experience? It was like I was hanging from a nearby tree, watching myself walk slowly down the field. I'd see myself, then see myself see myself, if that makes sense. I had a double out of body experience. 

Yet I was just walking down the sideline, it was like a movie, you know, where you could zoom in and out, make your own character, then BE the character. This whole action took about 30 seconds, but during that day I constantly felt this over and over, I've never been that high and conscious since, but wouldn't hesitate to try again.
