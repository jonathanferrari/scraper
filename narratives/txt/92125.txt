MDMA temperature and blood pressure.

I've been using MDMA on and off for 9 years now. Its an amazing substance.  In my quest for data, I recently measured blood pressure and body temp prior to dosing, and then T+1:30.  

BP before: 127 / 80
Heart Rate before: 64 bpm
Temp before: 98.5 degrees F.

BP T+1:30:  155 / 92
Heart Rate T+1:30:  76 bpm
Temp T+1:30:  98.5 degrees F.

None of this is surprising, just thought I'd share a data-point.
