Three friends and I decided to go bush and take what had been described as very strong clean LSD-25.  Prior to taking it I did about an hour of awareness meditation.

The LSD took about half an hour to come on.  I sat watching the river for a while and became immersed before going out to the old growth forest to watch the trees.  I had never seen this before - they were pulsing and bulging in and out and I could see green auras around them.  I became aware of my primate side, the side that knows instinctively how to connect to the earth - the side that knows how to survive if everything fell apart tommorrow.  Funnily enough it made a lot more sense when I had all four limbs on the ground like an ape.  I definitely had a better connection with the earth when my hands which I know so well were literally connected to the earth.

About 2 hours into the trip I saw what I can only describe as dna sigils interweaving themselves along my arms and hands.  They flowed along perfectly with the contours of my normal physical body.  I also saw slightly different sigils on the face of my girl friend.  These visuals were constant for about 4 more hours.

The visual state and my mental state seemed to be in unison during this time and the feeling was as if I was connected to the earth not as an ape as before, but as a human, but a human who could move and live on the earth in a way that I have never done before.  My posture and presence actually felt different - like another being - but it was definitely me, just me in a way that was unified with the earth.  There was something childlike, but there was also adult and animal, and throughout it all I was aware of the choice to be what I want to be.

I have a fair amount of experience with LSD but have never experienced anything quite like this.
