So there I was, sitting alone watching tv and the phone rings. I pick it up and it speaks, 'Hey, come hang out with us. We have tea' .. Knowing my friends, it was hard to think they meant orange pekoe, and sure enough they didn't. At the time of my arrival they had each had quite a few mugs and so in order to catch up I chugged back 3 or 4 myself, and so the night began.
  
Let me just say that throughout the night we didn't really stop drinking tea. We were playing video games. The title didn't matter, it wasn't going to be remembered at the end of the night anyways. As the psilocybin began to take effect the game screen seemed to pulsate with every shot fired, the volume turned up I could almost feel the kickback from the guns. Soon the game was off, and with the night still young we put on some music and drank some more tea.
  
Now, there are posters all over the walls, movie posters, music posters, and just plain trippy as hell posters. I found myself staring at one for 'The Crow' and suddenly, the character started making faces at me! Somewhere in the background I hear a door open, we had another guest. Not realizing we were drinking tea he found it a little strange that we were staring at the walls as we were surrounded by 3-dimensional music. We clued him in and he then pulled out a bag of weed, hooray!! We grabbed a bong, and smoked and drank tea to our hearts content.
  
The kettle was empty and so it had to be refilled, I ended up getting tagged as the poor sap to do it. Every trip to get some hot water (there were a few) was another adventure! Pupils as wide as saucers I would venture out the room into the dark and mysterious halls! 'Where is everyone?' I thought to myself, it was as if they had all abandoned this house. 'Good thing I won't have to talk to anyone' I thought, or said as I tip toed to the sink. Once filled I ventured back!
 
I walked into the room and there was a movie playing. How long had I been gone? And why are they all standing so far from the tv? Oh well, that wasn't important. We grabbed more shrooms and let them steep, then proceeded to drink more tea and .. **Scene Missing**

And so it was 4am and despite the fact that I had planned to spend the night, a crazy spontaneous idea popped into my head. 'I'm gonna go home now' I said, and they didn't even try to stop me. There I was, sitting behind the wheel of my car with a head full of psilocybin when it struck me... My Car Is So Big! I was entranced looking around my car, it was huge! You could fit like 20 people into it! And I began driving. I drove around town a bit thinking about how massive my car must look from the outside .. **Scene Missing, again**
 
I awoke the next day, car intact, clothes reaking like mushroom tea (I must've spilled it all over me) and brain still a bit fuzzy. All in all it was quite a night, maybe next time I'll drink more!! Hehe
