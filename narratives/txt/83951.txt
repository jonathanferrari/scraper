The first time I used MDMA it was from my best, trusted friend who was a pharmacy technician and finished top in his class 2008-07 1st of 600 in VA. I trusted him since I knew he had what he was talking about down. I took it orally. 

The effects for me were definitely 'everything is right in the world, and talk a whole lot more,' but I never experienced any difference in sense of touch, smell, or taste. I felt very normal. Completely normal in fact, maybe like taking 3 vico-profens. I never felt distracted, but I also haven't had any depressive tendencies after both tries. I experienced an afterglow both times as well. 

I've always been very resilient--it always takes more to get me messed up--pain killer, pot, perks or vics. But in all honesty I hardly ever mess with these drugs, its more occasional but I like to read about what I'm doing and be cautious. I shouldn't have any tolerance, and I had always thought MDMA was like some serious shit, I was disappointed. But the same people who were with me the night we tried it did far less of it than myself and were off the wall with pleasure...
