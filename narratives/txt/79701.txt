A few days ago, I wound up snorting and eating what I was later told was about 3 to 3.5 grams of ecstasy over a period of around 24 hours. 

Based on my experience with this substance long ago (fifteen or so years), I can report that I am certain it was very clean, and there were no physical hangovers. I spent most of the time stretching, and had a mild sweat during which time I felt that I was flushing out deep seated toxins from my body through the E and the stretching. 

Two days after this experience however, I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. It is a tingly lightness that doesn't feel bad, or weakening, but does remind me of the very early onset of a fainting feeling. There is no 'downer' mood alteration whatsoever - which I suspect has something to do with the cleanliness of the substance - but the fact that this dizziness has been going on now for about 36 hours, I am mildly concerned, but comforted by the fact that  this effect can continue for 'up to' 4 weeks in most cases. 

In any case, had I known that I would have this effect, which I now learned of afterwards, I certainly would not have ingested as much as I did.
