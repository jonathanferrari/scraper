Summary: 
I'll start out brief but expeditious, similar to that of a DMT trip. I've had many experiences behind this trip, although this time I could recall everything crystal clear. Among the handful of psychedelics I've consumed, dimethyltryptamine stood out from the crowd. An uncomparable high that'll put one on an emotional rollercoaster, or tossed into the mouth of the mythical creature and spat back out. It's a long way down... 

The Trip:
 It was a cold but calm night in December. Outside my window I could see the snow beginning to hug the pavement. My room was in low light, nothing but my television illuminating my view. I sat in my leather chair sitting on the fence between bored and content. I remember I had a bit of Dimethyl properly stored away, and the mood just striked upon me. With a small chillum pack of DMT crystals, I lifted my window open a quarter way, while a cold wind bombarded my torso. Inhaled, exhaled, then ripped it. I stuck my head out the window to exhale, having snowing accumulate on my head for a second. I swear...as soon as I dipped my head back into what seemed my 'room'..it hit me; like nothing else could. Complete utter slide-show vision took hold as I swung back in. Almost instantaneously my television set seemed a football field away. My bones, blood vessels, nerve- endings went 'hollow' as colors from unknown spectrums radiated from behind my scalp. I sunk back into my chair thinking about existence, art, time, and important figures in history.  Soon after 15 mins (seemed like 2 years), the radical hues subsided and my depth of time was restored.

Verdict:
Dimethyltryptamine, to me, is a very odd and intriguing molecule. Although one must be VERY careful, god forbid this substance falls into the wrong hands. This is a powerful psychedelic that one could easily overwhelm oneself with. Proceed with caution.
