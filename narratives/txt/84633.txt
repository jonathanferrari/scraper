So the night started out when my friend L called me to go eat and that he would drive. I brought some very pure DMT which is a totally different experience than the different colored crystals. I was using a bong and I packed some cannabis as a base and loaded my dose. Boy was I in for a ride...

... I smoked the bowl and in 3 seconds I start to feel my body and time slowing down I exhale and the inside of the car slowly transformed into a spaceship control panel. I blasted off and the trees in front of me became extremely colorful.. Maybe too colorful... Lol. and they start to dance and shake very rapidly while spinning. So I close my eyes and see myself sitting in a chair with two women hugging me and they were definitely pulsating different colors especially blue. Suddenly the spaceship ride was over and I felt sooo good like I was refreshed. I love dmt..
