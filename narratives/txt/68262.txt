About a year ago my roommate's friend gave him a this little bag of ketamine. I came home from work and my roommate tells me that he did some K earlier and that he wanted to get rid of it that night. There were already 2 other friends there so we figured the 4 of us could finish it that night. So we started taking bumps of it and I was feeling quite good then we started taking lines of it. This was a huge mistake. My nose really started to hurt and the room felt like it was spinning at a 100 mph. I laid down on my floor and couldn't move for about 10 mins. This is what we call being stuck in a K-Hole. It was horrible. When I finally managed to get back on feet my legs gave out and I fell straight to the floor. I really don't remember much after that except I tried skateboarding but I kept falling. The next morning I woke up to still this the the worst hangover I've ever had. In retrospect this was the dumbest drug I've ever tried. Its not like coke where you gotta take line after line to get fucked up.
