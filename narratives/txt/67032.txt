Although there is much I could talk about, I will keep this report concise.  I'm mainly writing to find out if others have shared my experience.

While in the height of (hypothetically) taking four mdma pills, I found myself having a number of frequent visuals.  One visual felt fully interactive.  I found myself in a small cave about with a ceiling of about 7 feet high.  The cave was dark and foggy and had pillars that looked to be stalagtites connected to stalacmites.  The walls and floor throughout the cave was covered in what appeared to be white, wooly, soft, spiderwebs.  I found that I was looking out from one of the pillars where the webbing had covered my body entirely.

Although this situation sounds like it should be frightening, I was not frightened in any way.  In fact, I felt warm and peaceful and a sense of connectedness with everything around me. While in the cave, I did not see any other individuals/entities.

Later while researching various metaphysical topics, I discovered that some individuals have described this same experience while meditating.  They referred to it as the 'buddhic realm.'  I'm curious to whether any other individuals have shared my experience.

My night was unforgettable and ranks up there as one of my top ten experiences of my life (although I had a hangover that lasted for two weeks).
