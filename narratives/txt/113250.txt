This is a recount of a particularly beautiful trip I had about 9 months ago. I have taken various psychedelic chemicals in various doses before and since, had the full range of experience from deep spiritual understanding to hellish stressful bad trips, so you could say that I am "experienced".

I had been looking forward to this day for some time. I hadn't really had a day off in weeks, and I had been really aching for a trip Â– many things had transpired that summer that I really needed some time alone with my thoughts to process, my girlfriend breaking up with me first among them. Not only that, but I had just received a new batch of LSD and I wanted to taste-test it.

I did my usual ritual of centering myself before dosing. Nothing too formalized, just tried to stay aware of and comfortable in my surroundings and my circumstances, whatever they were. Some meditation too. I even had a plan for what I wanted to do: my flatmate had agreed to drive me up to a nearby state park so I could do my favorite hike.

Dose day. Beautiful sunny Saturday, just a perfect day outside. I got up at 8 (early for me), did my morning wake-up routine, meditated a bit, then dosed at around 10 AM. 3 tabs. My flatmate's girlfriend was over and she had two cats, along with our cat that meant I had three cats to play with. And they were all in a playful mood. It was by far the smoothest come-up I have ever experienced, just a comfortable playful time with the cats. Eventually I noticed a shift in headspace, and some really minor visuals. It was nothing near as intense as my previous experiences with 3 hits, which led me to believe at the time that the tabs I had were underdosed. My mind was still very clear, so I didn't make the mistake of redosing. I was very content anyway, I felt very comfortable physically and mentally, exactly where I wanted to be.

Eventually the other people in the house started to get up. I'm planted on the couch and barely speaking except to giggle or answer questions. I seemed to be attracting an audience, either that or the cats were. I didn't mind. Everyone seemed happy.

Eventually my flatmate asked me if I still wanted to go to the park. I said "YES", and very enthusiastically started getting ready for a hike. I felt remarkably clear-headed and unencumbered, in touch with my body and with a clear sense of purpose. My mantra for that trip was "I'm on a quest to go to my favorite place!". I repeated it in my head over and over.

The drive over, everything was beautiful. I stared at the clouds and the trees, the cars, everything.

I remember my hike as a somewhat disconnected set of vignettes. Everything was unspeakably beautiful. I whispered to the trees and had some rather odd but harmless interactions with some people, as I had forgotten to wear sunglasses my pupils were wide open for everyone to see. For a while I thought the sun was following me, a blinding companion on my hike.

Eventually I made it to my favorite spot, a large oak tree in a field, with a little patch of short grass right under it perfect to sit in. It was the place I had first kissed my girlfriend. I found that I didn't really miss her, it just seemed unimportant. I thought about the generations of people who had sat under this oak doing exactly what I was doing, feeling more or less what I was feeling. I felt a strong connection to the past through that tree, and the tree seemed to have nothing but love in it for the strange humans who sat under it. It was fantastically comforting to be with that tree, looking out over the shifting forest. It felt like home. I walked back by a similarly circuitous and random-event-filled route. My flatmate refused to pick me up at the entrance to the state park, so I had to walk through civilization to get where he was. I definitely creeped a few people out, I could hear them thinking it. I did my best to ignore it and not act too weird.

Eventually I got home, and I was surprised to find my other flatmate's sister and her friend there. By this time I was beginning to come down, and I sat and drank tea with them and talked and probably watched TV, I don't really remember. Eventually I went to bed, and of course had a long sleepless night spent watching my ceiling. I think I went to sleep at around 4.

I think that trip more than any before or since, really had a profound impact on the way I experience the world. Since then I have started drawing more, and I have found it much easier to appreciate the mundane beauty of the world around me, and I feel a little more emotionally open too. I didn't end up getting what I was looking for, as I didn't really get over that girl for months afterwards, but I did get what I needed.
