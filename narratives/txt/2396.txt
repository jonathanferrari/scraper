I seem to be one of the unlucky people that 'crash' very hard although i have noticed it (obviously) being worse with stronger pils or higher in-take. 

My experiances often range between the following:

Self Consiousness: A sense that everyone is looking at me and talkin about me.
Feeling dirty and that people think i look dirty.
Feeling un-loved.
Jealousy: A very strong feeling that people are trying to take my girlfriend away.
Tiredness and resentment that it is all over.
Headaches and sensitive eye's.
Suspiciousness: Thinking that people who are talknig to you have a hidden agenda.
Get very up-tight and moody and just want to go home.
Very emotional and weepy about past events (usually with speed).
Insomnia.
Still an uncontrollable appreciation of music e.g. i could be brushing my teeth and dancing to music in my head.
Uncontrollable shakes.
