I spent about three days taking blue dolphins and other tabs.  The high was fantastic, but when it finally wore off, I became sad enough to kill myself.

The strongest feeling I had was that I was a terrible, worthless person, and that the world was sad and dirty.  I found myself pacing and crying and fidgeting.  I could not close my eyes to sleep, and I very badly wanted to be held.

My mind replayed every 'bad' or stupid thing I'd ever done, over and over, and I felt like I deserved to die.  

I found that taking a low dose of Prozac as I was coming down helped lessen my crashes.  I have clinical depression, so any break from my gloominess, like the one Ex provides, works really well.  When I'm depressed and coming out of a happy experience back to my sadness, I guess a crash is to be expected.

  Four tabs is a bit much for me, and after the second, the effects just aren't as strong.
