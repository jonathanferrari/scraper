Back in 2006 I did my first dose of many of MDMA.

Setting, London, more precisely Camden Town, at an underground rave party in a squat under a railway bridge. The music was booming and we bought 1 gram of MDMA for 4 of us at a very descent price. I made 2 parachutes of 125mg of MDMA each, it was an off white crystal, and down went the first parachute.

Fast forward half an hour and I'm feeling abnormally happy, I can feel the music in my stomach, as the techno booms away. Everyone is hugging and kissing each other, so I join in, definitely feeling the love. I dance away the night, and explore the squat. I feel like a million bucks. I dropped my second 125mg of MDMA about 5 hours after the first, and its around 5 AM. I throw up 45 minutes later, but I think most of the MDMA has entered my system. We continue raving away with my friends until about 9AM when the music stops.

I then leave the squat say goodbye to my friends and head off to get the bus back to my small university room in canterbury. The sun shinning is astonishingly bright, and all the colors look magic, however no luck, the bus fare is 11 pounds and I only have 6 pounds, so I have to beg in the bus station for 5 pounds to get my ride home... Luckily a couple of students help me out and I can get home. I put my mp3 player on my Drum n Bass playlist and dig the music for 2 hours on the ride home.

I get home and put on some music very loud in my room and dance by myself waiting for my friends to wake up. But I wore myself out so much over the past 24 hours I crash on my bed and sleep like a log for 24 hours.

This will be the first of many experiences with MDMA/XTC
