First Time With Molly

I decided today was a good day to try molly for the first time.

At 4:00 PM I swallowed 100mg of MDMA in the form of a gelcap. Shortly after, a friend picked me up to play some soccer. It
was hot out and I was worried that I might overheat so Ibrought some water just in case.

Molly still hadn't shown her face yet at 4:40 PM and we decided to pay my friend Cherek a visit at Panera. I copped a cup for a drink to hydrate myself. It was 4:50 PM at this point, and man, she came on fast. I'd told Cherek I was on molly and I was starting to feel it, no, definitely feeling it. I couldn't keep a smile off my face, I was so euphoric. The body high was tingly, warm, and pleasant. Similar to if I had drank a cup of coffee and taken 10mg hydrocodone. After spending thirty minutes at Panera, and decided to go to my friend Rice's house.

We arrive at Rice's house and I'm watching him play video games, I am mesmerized, really into it. At 6:00 PM, my friend Kenji
swings by.

I notice the effects coming down at 6:48 PM. Kenji and I left Rice's house at 9:00 PM. I was totally sober at this time, and the best part, literally no comedown. Upon reading up some more on the MDMA comedown, I discovered there would be little to
no comedown on doses below 150mg. Anything above 200mg is relatively safe but will leave one with a pretty shitty comedown and some post-roll deppression.

All in all, this just might be my favorite drug, too bad I have to wait 2-3 months to roll again because the shit is neurotoxic.
