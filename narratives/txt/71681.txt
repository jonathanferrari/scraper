I bought 15gr. of fresh mushrooms in a smart shop in Breda for 15Â€. As it has been a small 15 years ago (I'm 33 years) since I had shrooms I decided to take a less visual, more of a mind high type of trip. Which is why I chose Philosopher's Stone(s). Also, because I'm a philosophical kind of person and was expecting a lot from a magic mushroom named this way.

Anyway, I went home and took the full 15gr. at once. I knew this was going to be a heavy trip, but I have an extended experience with LSD, and more so with microns, a small LSD filled pill in the form of a lighter's fire stone, some say it's laced with amphetamine to boost the acid effect, but I'm not sure about this and this is of no importance in this report. And, as my friend could not assist me in case things went wrong I would have to undergo it all by myself and crawl out of hell by myself in case it'd turn bad. It's a test of self knowledge and self testing which I have always passed gloriously. 

I'll give a small timeline. As I was alone and I wanted some security, I penned down at what time I took them and did a written follow up every hour or so. This is a good thing to do if you're taking psychedelics on your own. It enables me to supervise the working of the drug on my mind. Shrooms do their thing and I know it. Hours are on a 24H-scale.

17:20: Ate 15gr. 

18:05: A very slight dizzy feeling, very mild LSD-esque feeling - a very mellow trippiness.

18:30: Sweaty hands, light increase in heart rate.

18:40: A very mild tipsy walk, motoric difficulties, colours starting to vibrate.

19:05: TV-set begins to 'wave', meaning it lost its solid form and showed waving motions. I also observed that I was yawning more than normally.

19:20: I went to lie in the garden to watch the sky. This is where the action really started, some two hours after consumption. The clouds were changing forms like dropping a spoon of milk in a filled coffeecup to see the milk reappear on the surface. It was pretty much like a 'cloud well' seen from atop. This was a respectable visual effect, even though the shroom box mentioned Philosopher's Stones are only mildly visual. I blinked my eyes to see it this wasn't just a hallucination, but it turned out the effect remained, so paradoxically it was a hallucination. What I liked about lying in the garden was some kind of connection I was feeling with the organic life around me: the grass was so kind to me, so accepting, just being there to softly support me and the plants and potted plants were really 'friendly', almost like a guest who's discrete, yet it would occur to me if he or she weren't there. There was a very relaxing peace going out from nature. This was a very enrichening experience.

20:00: The visual effects disappeared and started to think seemingly deeply about some issues I have with my wife. I had mixed feelings of anger and construction, which wouldn't be more or less 'out of space' if I hadn't eaten them all. Rational thinking was possible, even though the trippiness. LSD is for that matter a much more disorienting drug, no drug for beginner's, unless assisted. Also hearing my own voice was dramatic: through my voice I sensed my own insecurities: my mind was strong, but my body couldn't translate that strength appropriately.

From then on the follow up stopped. To make sure a bad trip wouldn't get any chance, I penned down in advance when the trip should more or less end. I had foreseen 24:00, but let's say that was an hour, hour and a half later. I had sweaty hands throughout the trip, was feeling pretty energetic. I had cigarettes and some kick ass marijuana, New York Diesel and Amnesia Haze, both very strong Soma Strains, but I drank water and didn't smoke. There just wasn't the impulse to supplement the trip with THC effects. I saw a disgusting anti-smoking ad and immediately decided to quite smoking. Which is still the case. I had hoped for therapeutic effects as I had experienced with previous LSD sessions and I can moderately subscribe to them: some of the issues with my wife got answered, but at the same time other questions arose. I also decided to quit smoking. 

I went to sleep around midnight. The trip was getting exhausting, even though the effects of trippiness were declining. I had also gotten up at 6 in the morning that day, so I was physically exhausted, too. Then a strange thing happened. Even though the effects were going away, I was experiencing visuals again, and at a certain point some nightmareish stuff came in my mind: thoughts of death, images of old and crippled china dolls appeared and as things go with bad trips a veil of death and darkness covered reality. I got up and had a large meal and a vitamin drink (Vitamin C is said to help gain control again). I went to sleep and got up with a very soft head ache and a slight feeling of being depressed. The other day I was OK and the conclusions I had reached from my thinking were integrated assertively in my personality. So, I'm very satisfied with the episode of subconscious rubbish clean up therapy. It was all by myself and I made it by myself. I feel stronger, now, and empowered. I don't know if this is an effect you can actually look up, but in my case I cleaned out my closet and all is well now. Maybe it turns out differently for you. Also observe that there was no giggly part. It was all pretty serious. 

I guess it's called Philosopher's Stone, because it makes me feel reflective, not recreative with the giggling and wanting to act stupid and all that. I think it's good for (seemingly) deep talk. But maybe all this is because my mind set was leaning towards the pondering, the problem solving, than towards hedonism and mindless fun.

I can advise the 15gr. for experienced shroomers, or synthetic psychonauts. I'd do half if you like to share or have a manageable trippy buzz for a couple of hours (with obliged assistance for the unexperienced). Next time I'd like some more visual shrooms. Hawai'ian, for instance.

Cheers and may you all be happy.
