I took 1 tab of MDMA about 1:00am on December 24th.  The effect of the pill took about 40 minutes to kick in.  At first I had a sick feeling in my entire body, followed by a sudden rush of energy.  A feeling like I would expect from Crystal Meth.  Within 20 minutes of these first effects, I experienced an awareness of touch and sound.  Everything had a softer side to it.

The total experience lasted until 8:00am.  I then slept for 3 hours.  Upon waking, I felt very week, and very thirsty.  Kind of fuzzy in the head, like a long night of drinking.  I attended holiday functions that afternoon, and upon returning home I took another tab about 8:00pm.  I again felt the sickness in my stomach, and never reached the peak I had experienced earlier that day.  About 11:00pm I took another tab, this time without the sick feeling, but a very strong peak.  Again with strong effects of touch and sound.

I finally went to bed about 3:00am on December 25.  I woke up about 8:30am and again had a need for some water.  All day I have experienced a mild sick feeling in my entire body, and some joint pain.
