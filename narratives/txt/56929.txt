I have experienced many drugs( including salvia) before but had never experienced something as intense as DMT.  My friends have all done DMT before and I was familiar with the affects.  They had told me to take a week or so before to become more intune with my psyche (even more than I was).  When I felt I was ready I told my friend and we took a drive to a familiar spot in the woods. 

After a few minutes of preparation I him prepare the pipe.  I took three rips before I was no longer able to take anymore.  I then leaned back in my car and he left the car so I could trip with no distractions.  I then began to feel a weird taste of bouncy ball in my mouth and began to think I was seizuring.  Somehow I kept this thought to myself.  After a few seconds of this horrible thought I saw him out of my rear-view mirror playing with sock poi so I figured I was safe.  I then began to sit back and welcome the trip.  I looked outside and saw everything turning colors very rapidly.  I heard what I later figured was a guide helping me through the trip.  Everything was starting to turn into unfamiliar objects as they melted and turned psychodelic colors.  I tried to listen to the guide but could not make out was it was saying.  Then everything started to flash back to normal as if reality was slowly coming back.  I managed to step out of my car and started walking around.  I was able to speak again as reality started to fully come back.  I waited a while to start driving again and tried to tell my buddy what I saw and heard but my memory of specific details started to fade.  What I wrote down hear is all I can really remember.
