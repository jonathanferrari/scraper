Me and my friend did ecstasy on Friday. Today is Monday and I'm just crying for no reason. It is terrible... The depression is just so big I don't know what to do... I'm just crying. I swear I will never do it again and I just wish to get back to normal. 

I had done it before, too, like about 10 times, but never that much. I had taken 3 pills on one night the most. But this time I took 5. Very bad decision. 

My girlfriend told me she was also crying for no reason once she had amphetamine hang over. I didn't understand. But now I do.

No good.
